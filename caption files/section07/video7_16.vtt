00:00.750 --> 00:04.890
Now let's take an overview of what we learned so far in this section.

00:05.740 --> 00:12.170
And this section we took a look at what is a restful API and understood the principles behind it.

00:12.970 --> 00:21.100
Then we moved on to the request types that we can use with HDTV or namely HTP methods.

00:21.130 --> 00:27.730
We looked at four main methods and those were GET POST put and delete.

00:27.730 --> 00:32.590
We also looked at two less commonly used methods and those were had and options

00:40.350 --> 00:44.210
that brought us to response code that we received when we made any

00:47.690 --> 00:54.050
that brought us to response codes that we received when we made any request types that we discussed.

00:54.050 --> 01:00.440
And the response codes were enjoying from 200 to five hundreds with a descriptor status of requests

01:01.790 --> 01:06.480
that we checked out the strategic lines that we can use to make requests.

01:06.520 --> 01:11.060
Those include any web browser or the programmatic ones.

01:11.270 --> 01:15.570
And in the next step we started building our own respites API.

01:15.730 --> 01:23.530
We've created our model service and finally a controller where we actually find our restful API in the

01:23.530 --> 01:24.600
next section.

01:24.640 --> 01:30.040
We've gone over the rest for way PCs that were built and explained everything one by one so that we

01:30.040 --> 01:33.190
can deeply understand what each and every element does.

01:36.300 --> 01:42.390
Before we started implementing HTP lines in our code we took an important step and affected our code

01:42.660 --> 01:46.870
so it can be easily maintainable in the future for doing that.

01:46.920 --> 01:52.560
We upgraded our service methods for interacting with a repository and then removed the tight coupling

01:52.590 --> 01:55.810
of our control over to repository implementation.

01:55.830 --> 01:59.170
We also handled.

02:00.270 --> 02:02.580
We also handled exceptions that might occur.

02:02.580 --> 02:08.100
And of course we've done a couple of other things to improve our code for any developer and the users

02:08.100 --> 02:13.900
we're going to use our API for the claims that we can use to make HTB requests.

02:13.920 --> 02:21.450
We'll look at a good alternative and we looked at a good alternative we could use and that was Springs

02:21.570 --> 02:24.650
template right after this template.

02:24.840 --> 02:29.890
We checked out another awesome client that we could use to implement that in our application.

02:29.970 --> 02:36.840
And that was for incline from Netflix again with different client making requests were easier creating

02:36.840 --> 02:45.030
an interface for the producer application and Kellan and then calling the interface methods by working

02:45.030 --> 02:46.130
on fayn client.

02:46.140 --> 02:52.020
We also learned about another project and other great project from Netflix which was Eureka's server

02:52.500 --> 02:58.260
Yuriko was a service registry and discovery for managing multi application environments so that you

02:58.260 --> 03:01.230
could get the application talking to each other were easily

03:05.180 --> 03:11.770
when we finished all.

03:12.020 --> 03:16.820
When we finished discovering the world of restfully eyes you had an assignment that you can work on

03:16.820 --> 03:18.710
your restfully API.

03:18.950 --> 03:23.990
You could have used either the project that I made available for you on guitar dot com or you could

03:24.100 --> 03:31.090
start from scratch either way I hope you do well on your exercise and let all these concepts sink in.

03:32.930 --> 03:40.440
All right we've come to the end of another great section we're read very written a lot of code.

03:40.570 --> 03:45.730
I hope you enjoy this section and if you have any problems with your own restful API implementation

03:46.270 --> 03:49.280
don't hesitate to ask me about it so I can help you.

03:50.450 --> 03:57.060
In the next section we'll bring all these awesome will bring all these awesome information together

03:57.270 --> 03:59.560
to create a full fledged web application.

03:59.590 --> 04:06.090
Will use time we've restful API as spring data and of course much more.

04:06.320 --> 04:08.240
It's going to be an amazing section.

04:08.240 --> 04:12.510
Before I talk about it more I'll be waiting to see on the next section.
