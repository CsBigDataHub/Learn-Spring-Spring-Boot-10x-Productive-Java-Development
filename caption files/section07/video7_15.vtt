Know it's time for you to work on your own restful AAPI start by checking out the guidelines that were

00:06.750 --> 00:13.080
laid out when we started this section if you need to think about that application that backend you've

00:13.080 --> 00:14.150
been thinking about.

00:14.190 --> 00:18.460
You've been dreaming of to make your application come true.

00:18.460 --> 00:24.040
Break it down to is building blocks from components to the basic data models that you use run persisting

00:24.040 --> 00:26.370
data to a database.

00:26.590 --> 00:32.110
When you complete breaking it all down create your models prepare your repositories and the service

00:32.110 --> 00:38.470
classes that you use to manage your repositories and finally create your controllers your requests mappings

00:38.470 --> 00:40.480
for the actions that you're going to take.

00:40.840 --> 00:46.260
Of course when you're building the request path structures think carefully on HGTV requests methods

00:46.330 --> 00:53.060
and naming them if you need me to reveal your code and give me my feedback on it.

00:53.260 --> 00:55.420
I'll be more than happy to do that.

00:55.600 --> 01:00.020
Just create a room for me on get hopped up come so we can move on from there.

01:01.360 --> 01:07.380
All right I hope you do great on your exercise and we'll create a production rate EPR for yourself.

01:08.020 --> 01:13.010
To take an overview of what we learn and done in the section I'll see on the next video.
