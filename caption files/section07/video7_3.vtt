HTP is built in with a set of status codes for various types of scenarios.

00:06.570 --> 00:15.150
Now let's take out those deeper response codes are ranging from 200 to five hundreds and there are all

00:15.150 --> 00:18.300
this think coats to represent a unique situation.

00:19.320 --> 00:25.190
200 level codes are for successful cases where everything works as expected.

00:25.380 --> 00:37.980
For example 200 means simply that HTP OK and 201 represents H.T. to be created 300 level codes are used

00:37.990 --> 00:45.420
for redirection purposes and good indicators if resources relocated to somewhere else in the network.

00:45.430 --> 00:53.020
For example if your turn or C 303 it indicates that the resource you're looking for is moved to somewhere

00:53.020 --> 00:53.380
else.

00:53.400 --> 01:01.010
And of course we're bodies should contain the information regarding where do resources relocated 400

01:01.010 --> 01:09.850
level codes are indicators of glide errors collide here can be either a end user or an application request

01:10.010 --> 01:11.500
resource.

01:11.610 --> 01:17.250
For example if a user is searching for something and the field that the user is searching can be found

01:17.250 --> 01:18.350
within the resource.

01:18.600 --> 01:28.530
Dan 404 HTP not found is the return called Cline's she'll be receiving 500 codes are on the contrary

01:28.790 --> 01:36.230
server related status codes these code ranges used to indicate that the server is either incapable or

01:36.560 --> 01:43.080
not available to slow response to request 500 itself is very popular.

01:43.080 --> 01:49.380
And if you didn't know about ATP's telescopes before it's highly likely that you encountered this code

01:50.310 --> 01:57.870
Disko simply says that there is an internal server error as we just said a stupid response codes are

01:57.930 --> 02:04.710
built into the protocol meaning that even if you don't even use them they're still there and embedded

02:04.710 --> 02:07.610
to your response with HGP operations.

02:08.950 --> 02:14.430
Lee's response skills are useful indicators on the status of the requests you made towards the end point.

02:15.310 --> 02:19.760
From the developers perspective as being a best practice teres a prize.

02:19.930 --> 02:22.530
You should definitely make use of the response code when.

02:22.620 --> 02:28.420
So in response to your client depending on the status of your request you should be indicating your

02:28.420 --> 02:31.660
client within this range of status codes.

02:31.670 --> 02:32.900
All right.

02:32.900 --> 02:38.120
I think we're building a very nice foundation for HTP requests and responses that we're going to develop

02:38.150 --> 02:40.080
in the upcoming videos.

02:40.870 --> 02:47.170
So now we know what requests we can make with HTP and what are the possible outcomes as being the response

02:47.170 --> 02:47.740
code.

02:48.910 --> 02:55.440
To talk about the clients which make the requests and receive responses I'll see on the next media.
