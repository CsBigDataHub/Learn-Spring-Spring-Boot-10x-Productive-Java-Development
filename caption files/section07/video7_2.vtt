Let's talk about the ways of requests met with HTP.

00:05.840 --> 00:09.060
There are four basic types of requests for HGP.

00:09.410 --> 00:14.840
Let's take a look at what those are and what's important about these four requests is that they represent

00:14.960 --> 00:18.640
crud or create read update and delete operations.

00:22.620 --> 00:28.970
First we have get as the name implies yet provides us the present nation of the resource.

00:29.130 --> 00:35.270
Thinking about a method with a return type in Java yet will be providing us a return type of objects.

00:37.390 --> 00:43.570
Second one is put put generally use to either update or modify a resource.

00:43.570 --> 00:47.620
However in some rare cases it can even be used to create a new resource

00:51.400 --> 00:58.830
toward one as post purpose of the post is t create a new resource from scratch depending on the type

00:58.830 --> 01:05.510
of post and point you prepared to data that you want to be created and simply posted the form.

01:05.530 --> 01:10.070
And the last one in our four basic methods is delete.

01:10.130 --> 01:16.360
It's all clear and yet it's used to delete an existing resource.

01:16.370 --> 01:20.980
Now we come to the less commonly use HGP methods first.

01:20.980 --> 01:28.120
We have had head is short for header and is used to fetch meta data or header data for the resource

01:28.120 --> 01:29.590
that we're interested in.

01:31.550 --> 01:34.210
And the second one is options.

01:34.260 --> 01:40.490
Let's assume that you want to know what 80 to be operations that you can use on a particular resource.

01:40.510 --> 01:42.780
That's where options comes in.

01:42.780 --> 01:52.110
You make a request of the resource with HTP options and resource gives you back the possible operations.

01:52.130 --> 01:58.810
That's all we need to know about HTP request types available to us for various operations on resources.

01:58.820 --> 02:04.340
Now we know the request types and of course the server around our rest interface will return a response

02:04.340 --> 02:11.850
with headers resource when requested and most importantly our response code so to analyze the response

02:11.850 --> 02:14.020
code with HTP requests.

02:14.020 --> 02:15.400
I'll see you on the next video.
