00:01.510 --> 00:04.130
We're almost coming to an end of our journey.

00:04.660 --> 00:10.300
It's been such a pleasure to be with you in this journey and we definitely learned a lot along the way.

00:11.220 --> 00:15.260
We discovered the amazing world of spring and spring boot.

00:15.360 --> 00:21.480
We kept digging into the fundamentals of spring family such as spring data Spring last spring and we

00:21.480 --> 00:25.730
see a much more.

00:25.770 --> 00:31.920
We of course didn't stop there and discovered more awesome components that we can use within our applications

00:32.160 --> 00:40.520
in the extras section those included spring actuator swagger spring male with time wave and many more

00:41.690 --> 00:48.870
of course spring Pamelor keeps growing each and every day and we shouldn't be stopping here to as a

00:48.870 --> 00:54.980
result of a Walwyn cloud technologies and more and more enterprises moving into the cloud.

00:54.990 --> 01:02.460
Spring became one of the most fundamental elements of cloud and label systems with its widely accepted

01:02.580 --> 01:05.200
and growing cloud native offerings.

01:05.370 --> 01:10.550
Spring is by far the number one choice for nearly all the enterprises around the world

01:13.250 --> 01:18.150
thinking about the biggest showcases of sprinkle out native visibility.

01:18.380 --> 01:25.340
Netflix the company behind your favorite TV shows and movies offers these amazing experiences by the

01:25.340 --> 01:30.180
platform they built around spraying Twitter.

01:30.370 --> 01:37.360
The hugely popular micro-blogging social network also relies on Jawa and spring technologies.

01:37.580 --> 01:42.410
They used to deliver the platform to the masses with the help of Ruby on Rails.

01:42.410 --> 01:49.220
However when those masses grow to be hundreds of millions of people it didn't really work out and they

01:49.220 --> 01:54.360
switched their focus on the power of Java and Sprint platform.

01:54.370 --> 02:01.870
In fact a vast majority of Fortune 500 companies rely on Jwala technologies and considering almost all

02:01.870 --> 02:04.430
of these enterprises are running on a cloud.

02:04.480 --> 02:09.570
What means with the Java technologies is really cloud offering of spring.

02:09.610 --> 02:13.240
So as you can see spring has proven itself to be successful.

02:13.240 --> 02:17.550
Each and every day by the largest enterprises around the world.

02:17.770 --> 02:24.720
This is mainly because again the shifting focus in the cloud and this training we actually sneak peek

02:24.730 --> 02:27.800
at how services interact as Microsoft rises.

02:27.880 --> 02:34.330
When we ran two applications side by side and deployed Eureka's so of Netflix in the middle of so that

02:34.570 --> 02:42.290
they can communicate easily with Netflix inclined in an environment like cloud in the upcoming weeks.

02:42.440 --> 02:48.230
I'll be publishing my next course on cloud technologies and especially developing market services for

02:48.230 --> 02:48.750
the cloud.

02:48.770 --> 02:55.320
With spring technologies so you should definitely check that out when it's coming out and I'll be giving

02:55.320 --> 02:56.700
you a generous discount.

02:56.700 --> 02:58.680
Since you already taken this course.
