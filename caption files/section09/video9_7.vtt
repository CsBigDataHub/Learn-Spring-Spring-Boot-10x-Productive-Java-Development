Now let's take a moment to overview what we learn in this extra section in this section.

00:09.000 --> 00:15.980
We've discovered some real co-features and projects that we can make use of in our own projects.

00:16.020 --> 00:22.370
We started off at Spring dev tools and we reload with Springdale tools and especially with the little

00:22.380 --> 00:26.590
plug in on top of it you could really simplify your development workflow.

00:29.170 --> 00:35.860
With a simple ID configuration and dependencies you can make any kind of change in your project and

00:35.860 --> 00:41.630
see the results instantly without restarting your whole application.

00:41.650 --> 00:48.460
Then we started documenting our API with swagger with swagger and a little bit of a configuration you

00:48.460 --> 00:55.060
could have real great working API documentation where you can even make your request and Syria but

00:57.960 --> 01:05.310
next we included spring actuator in our project and gain lots of great points for our application inherently

01:06.670 --> 01:12.190
actual endpoints were to give useful insights and metrics to our production applications.

01:13.690 --> 01:19.360
Down we scheduled our actions with spring scheduler so that we could have a separate thread for running

01:19.360 --> 01:21.950
some background actions for our application.

01:23.720 --> 01:31.280
We also got rid of some boilerplate code in our application we had project Lombok Lombok library we

01:31.280 --> 01:37.280
could simply annotate our class and how good are setters constructors much more without even writing

01:37.280 --> 01:38.580
a single line of code.

01:40.440 --> 01:47.490
We also used Time Wave and springs e-mailing to regenerate and send them all five templates and e-mails.

01:47.670 --> 01:53.460
That was also a great combination of what we learned with time leave and added mailing ability on top

01:53.460 --> 01:54.020
of it.

01:55.380 --> 02:00.910
With this extra section we did a great job of getting other libraries and projects that we can use within

02:00.910 --> 02:02.160
our applications.

02:02.320 --> 02:08.500
Those which make things tremendously easy for certain and even repetitive tasks that we have to do every

02:08.500 --> 02:13.630
day we learned a lot and covered a lot.

02:13.660 --> 02:19.060
I hope you enjoyed this extra section and highly encourage you to use them in your own projects to see

02:19.060 --> 02:20.360
the difference they make.

02:21.670 --> 02:26.250
To conclude and rough up our training I'll be seeing you in the next section.
