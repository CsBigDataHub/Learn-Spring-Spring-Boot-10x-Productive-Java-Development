00:01.100 --> 00:09.260
End this section we're going to be taking a look at spring down tools and we reload death tolls and

00:09.450 --> 00:16.550
we're reload when combined together are great do all the power tools when you actually developing web

00:16.550 --> 00:19.870
applications and any kind of spring applications.

00:21.570 --> 00:28.410
Their tools provides you the software capabilities that you can instantly change the application behavior

00:29.070 --> 00:36.980
and liberal out simply an extension of that in the browser so that you can see your changes that way.

00:38.700 --> 00:47.050
To show you how it works I'm going to be making use of our spring and we see application for doing that.

00:47.070 --> 00:50.340
I'm simply going to open up my spring and we see application

00:55.750 --> 00:59.180
and can make use of spring day tools and we reload.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.370
We have to do a couple of things.

01:01.420 --> 01:09.340
First we have to get the spring daybed tools dependency and for that I'm going to open up Firefox and

01:09.640 --> 01:21.100
go to maybe a repository and I'll say Mayrant repository and into maybe a repository.

01:21.380 --> 01:24.680
I'm going to be looking at spring day Tilse

01:27.590 --> 01:40.200
And here we have it and let's get the latest version which is 1.5 to and I'm going to copy dependency

01:40.460 --> 01:50.940
and switch back to my ID and in my palm file I'm going to add it right below the trap door.

01:52.030 --> 01:52.790
Here we go.

01:52.940 --> 02:01.890
We have our own tools dependency and Maybin as a result when you're right now to make use of their tools.

02:02.030 --> 02:10.790
We have to be enabling hot swapping in our ID and for doing that in the intelligence we have to be making

02:10.790 --> 02:13.800
a change in the registry of the application.

02:13.910 --> 02:23.590
So to do that I'm going to be searching for the registry and I'll use command shift and a and I'll be

02:23.590 --> 02:32.250
looking for registry and in the registry the property that I'm looking for is the compiler dot automake

02:32.260 --> 02:36.970
that allow dot when dot app running.

02:36.990 --> 02:48.670
So let's go down below and find the property that we're going to change and in decompiler I'm going

02:48.670 --> 02:57.100
to be switching on compiler automake allow went up is running so I'll hit the tech and I'm going to

02:57.100 --> 02:58.370
close.

02:58.510 --> 03:04.420
And as you can see from the notification right here we have to we're starting our ID to make changes

03:04.420 --> 03:05.720
in effect.

03:05.960 --> 03:11.140
So I'm simply going to close my ID and then restart it.

03:22.110 --> 03:24.950
And I'm going to open up my project again.

03:27.430 --> 03:28.710
Here we go.

03:28.830 --> 03:36.090
We are ready to test out their tools but before we actually see the changes in our browser we have to

03:36.090 --> 03:41.710
be using the literal load extension and for doing that I'm going to use.

03:41.760 --> 03:53.960
So far it is time and I'll open up Safari and I'll be looking for the reload and spring

03:58.250 --> 03:59.970
and his search results.

03:59.970 --> 04:10.460
We have the hot swapping options for spraying and in the official page I'm going to go to the world

04:10.520 --> 04:19.640
dot com and I'm going to get the Safari extension.

04:19.820 --> 04:27.200
I'm simply going to open it up and cross it so that it can be installed in my extensions list.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.190
All right.

04:28.190 --> 04:31.440
I have my little rural extension installed.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.140
And as you notice we have a new icon right here.

04:36.190 --> 04:42.740
It's for the literal load extension to test out our extension.

04:42.800 --> 04:47.170
I'm going to run my application and switch back to Safari again.

04:47.390 --> 04:50.060
So I'll simply run my application now.

04:53.630 --> 05:00.170
And our application is starting up.

05:00.270 --> 05:06.570
Here we go to see our changes in effect I'm going to use a side by side window.

05:06.630 --> 05:12.920
So I'm going to shrink down my intelligent window and put it right here.

05:13.440 --> 05:21.560
And let's shrink down our navigation and maybe we can even get rid of it and right next to it.

05:21.720 --> 05:29.040
I'm going to use my Safari window and to show you how it works.

05:29.140 --> 05:38.830
I'm going to run my application so far that I'm going to go to 80 89.

05:39.050 --> 05:42.230
And here we have our application.

05:42.330 --> 05:46.800
So let's try and change something and see it instantly.

05:47.100 --> 05:55.950
To do that I'll change my product's navigation and say it's going to be products list.

05:55.950 --> 06:04.270
And when I say it as you can see from the left side of the screen our navigation button is now updated

06:04.630 --> 06:07.540
with the products list that I just provided.

06:08.630 --> 06:13.360
And this also changed the spring in the application text right here.

06:13.400 --> 06:18.440
So for doing that I'm going to say and we see Kreta application.

06:18.440 --> 06:28.070
And when I hit say here we go we have our changes instantly appearing on our browser and you can really

06:28.250 --> 06:33.340
simply extend this behavior to any kind of spring component that you have.

06:33.740 --> 06:38.040
You're not just limited with the text or images in your application.

06:38.180 --> 06:42.800
You can simply swap your components and other things as well.

06:42.800 --> 06:49.010
Feel free to check out spring day tools and liberal out and play around with it in your development

06:49.010 --> 06:55.760
environment and make sure that you only keep your daily tools dependency only in your development purposes.

06:56.150 --> 07:02.010
Otherwise it's not a very nice thing to have it in a production grade application.

07:02.060 --> 07:08.030
Hope you can make use of this spring down tools and roll out in your projects and I'll be seeing you

07:08.030 --> 07:09.130
in the next video.
