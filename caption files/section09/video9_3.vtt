00:00.550 --> 00:08.020
The next thing that we're going to take a look at is spring actuator spring actuator as the official

00:08.020 --> 00:16.390
page says allows you to monitor and interact with your application with pre-build in endpoints for any

00:16.390 --> 00:18.220
application that you're going to build.

00:19.450 --> 00:26.710
And if we check out the last say whose list of alternatives for any application that you're going to

00:26.710 --> 00:31.580
provide and you can even customize the endpoints for any application

00:34.470 --> 00:37.340
to make use of Springboro actuator.

00:37.770 --> 00:42.970
Let's go to our Maybin repository.

00:43.220 --> 00:54.390
And what we're looking for as spring boot starter an actuator

00:58.640 --> 01:03.610
and let's take out the latest one 1 8 5 2.

01:04.130 --> 01:07.530
And this copy the dependency.

01:07.540 --> 01:10.830
Now let's switch back to our ID now.

01:10.900 --> 01:15.110
And I opened up my spring and we see Project right here.

01:15.520 --> 01:26.170
And if I go to my Palm file in my palm file I'm simply going to provide my dependency right below.

01:26.330 --> 01:37.170
And if you say you read Maven is already resolved that so check out our actuator endpoints.

01:37.200 --> 01:48.230
I'm going to run my application.

01:48.440 --> 01:49.900
Our application is starting up

01:53.900 --> 02:01.370
and as you can see here we have a map lots of different points for our application even if we didn't

02:01.370 --> 02:02.230
provide them.

02:03.170 --> 02:14.540
And if we take a closer look at them we how Heldt beans luggers trace conflict Propes dump info mappings

02:14.870 --> 02:22.450
and lots of water and points for applications to use so to check out dam.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.430
Let's go to Firefox now

02:27.430 --> 02:38.220
and I'm going to be opening up a new window and in a new window I'll go to my application and provide

02:38.230 --> 02:45.440
the port as 80 89 and then I'm simply going to say mappings.

02:46.720 --> 02:51.300
And in the mappings we can see that were unauthorized.

02:51.340 --> 02:55.300
The reason for that the end point is a secured one.

02:55.300 --> 02:59.720
We have to be all right in the security role for our testing purposes.

03:00.500 --> 03:10.310
To do that I'll switch back to my ID and in my ID I'll go to my application properties

03:13.340 --> 03:15.460
in my application properties.

03:15.590 --> 03:25.250
I'm going to say and points that mappings and sensitive is going to be false.

03:25.250 --> 03:35.620
So if you switch back to Firefox again and if the refresh to page Rigaud we have the full mappings for

03:35.620 --> 03:43.750
our application and you can see everything we have and the things that we don't have in our actual configuration

03:44.080 --> 03:46.410
the ones that provide it with spring.

03:46.510 --> 03:54.430
And the cool thing about actuator endpoints as you've seen here you can simply override their configurations

03:54.490 --> 04:00.700
with couple of alternatives and you can disable or enable the ones that you don't need.

04:01.000 --> 04:08.530
Let's take out another endpoint and this time I'm going to be enabling the environments and point and

04:08.860 --> 04:18.960
I'll say endpoints environment and sensitivity is going to be false.

04:19.030 --> 04:26.590
So if I say that our application context is going to be refreshed as you can see in our console and

04:26.890 --> 04:33.150
when it's done I can be able to go to my endpoint.

04:33.350 --> 04:49.520
So if I go to my browser and I'll say localhost A.D. 89 and slash environment here we go we have a full

04:49.520 --> 04:52.280
list of our environment variables.

04:52.280 --> 04:56.390
And as you can see we have our application port.

04:56.450 --> 04:58.690
We how our Joe on time.

04:58.910 --> 05:04.750
And we how lots of other environment variables that we weren't even aware of.

05:06.480 --> 05:14.820
As you can see with this simple example spring actuator is a great way to extend your application so

05:14.880 --> 05:20.720
that you can monitor and get some real time statistics about your application usage.

05:21.790 --> 05:28.770
Main purpose of spring actuator endpoints is about the cloud park for spraying.

05:28.870 --> 05:34.210
So for that part I'm planning on the walloping a Macra services training.

05:34.270 --> 05:39.000
So in that training we're going to be digging into these actuator endpoints.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.840
So make sure to check that out.

05:41.980 --> 05:43.480
I'll be seeing you in the next video.
