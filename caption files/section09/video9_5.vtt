00:01.120 --> 00:04.830
In this video we're going to be talking about the project.

00:04.840 --> 00:16.500
Lombok project Lumbergh is an unnoticed project licensed under MIT Lomberg is a great Plug-In great

00:16.500 --> 00:23.820
project so that you can make use in your projects mean your Toyo's in your classes and get rid of lots

00:23.820 --> 00:25.250
of moral code.

00:27.620 --> 00:36.500
As you can see a list of annotations provided by Lombok you can provide a non-rule annotation you can

00:36.680 --> 00:41.060
provide getters and setters to string equals and hash code.

00:41.200 --> 00:48.160
No Ark's Deda and lots of other annotations in your objects and properties.

00:50.500 --> 00:58.340
To show you how all things work with Lombok I'm going to go to my main repository and first get the

00:58.700 --> 01:07.100
Lumbergh dependency so to do that I'll go to my repository and look for Project.

01:07.220 --> 01:11.620
Lombok and in the Lombok.

01:11.640 --> 01:21.210
I'm going to get the latest one which is one the 16 got 16 and I'm going to get to dependency and with

01:21.220 --> 01:27.030
that dependency what I'm going to do now is I'm going to create a new Mavin project

01:29.600 --> 01:42.900
and within that Navan project I'm going to say Lumbergh D-Mo. and the artifact is going to be Lombok.

01:42.990 --> 01:50.280
I'm all set and let's create the project.

01:50.470 --> 01:58.600
Here we have a template Mabon project and lets enable the auto import and in my profile the first thing

01:58.600 --> 02:03.580
I'm going to do is add the Lombok dependency so to do that.

02:03.580 --> 02:10.060
I'm going to create a dependency stack right here and within that dependency stack I'm going to put

02:10.060 --> 02:12.030
the dependency of Lumbergh.

02:12.370 --> 02:20.620
All right so my maven has already to resolve the dependency so I can make use of Lumbergh in my project.

02:20.620 --> 02:25.830
Now to check it out and hold things work with Lomborg.

02:26.070 --> 02:28.610
Let's go to a class.

02:28.710 --> 02:29.760
My main class

02:32.420 --> 02:39.920
and as you can see since this is a template project we don't have any classes so let's create one the

02:40.130 --> 02:46.860
product class that we use with all projects that were built and build up on it.

02:46.870 --> 02:58.120
All right in my product class as you would remember from my previous projects we had name we had a description

03:03.040 --> 03:07.060
and we also had type

03:11.650 --> 03:14.060
category.

03:14.560 --> 03:20.870
And finally a price.

03:20.950 --> 03:21.980
All right.

03:22.200 --> 03:27.630
That was the product class that we all built in the previous projects.

03:27.760 --> 03:34.690
But the other thing that we did with the product class before we provided the getters and setters methods

03:35.170 --> 03:42.870
all by our hands we generated them but they were all in here all in the class.

03:43.010 --> 03:46.710
Lundborg You don't have to do any of that.

03:46.750 --> 03:50.240
That is all done by the data adaptation of non-book.

03:50.470 --> 03:59.710
So remember that we have this class and let's put the data annotation right up on top of the class that

03:59.710 --> 04:01.040
we created.

04:01.540 --> 04:08.050
And as you can see the data annotation is coming from Lombok and if we build this project right now

04:08.140 --> 04:16.010
and check out the compiled class file we should be surprised by the changes that we did add.

04:16.030 --> 04:23.350
So let's say you are file and go to my own projects and let's build our project.

04:23.530 --> 04:31.500
So for building maven we should use install.

04:31.660 --> 04:37.210
And here we go let's stick out the source file and what we have there.

04:38.830 --> 04:44.230
And in the classes if we drag it right here.

04:44.230 --> 04:45.310
Here we go.

04:45.460 --> 04:54.280
We have a No our constructor we have all the getters and setters for our properties we have equals we

04:54.280 --> 05:03.130
have can equal we have hash code and to string all that you do with the methods that we could otherwise

05:03.370 --> 05:08.380
provide by hand they are all provided by lumber itself.

05:08.380 --> 05:09.850
Isn't that beautiful.

05:09.850 --> 05:11.650
Isn't that great.

05:11.650 --> 05:15.750
And let's look out some other properties under dietician's of Lombok.

05:16.090 --> 05:24.590
So to do that I'm going to go to my product class and I'll say all Ark's constructor.

05:24.640 --> 05:25.290
All right.

05:26.400 --> 05:29.720
And let's install our project again.

05:35.820 --> 05:46.250
And let's just reopen our product class and check out our all Ark's constructor.

05:46.270 --> 05:47.150
Here we go.

05:48.270 --> 05:54.780
You can see that there is a constructor properties annotation and we have all the properties of our

05:54.780 --> 05:55.820
product object.

05:55.920 --> 06:01.920
And as we expect the all Oxx constructor is right here.

06:02.070 --> 06:10.260
And as our last example let's assume that you are checking for an all in set of every object every property

06:10.260 --> 06:16.860
that you have and for that each property you have to be typing a lot of checks for no.

06:17.280 --> 06:22.760
So to avoid that let's use the non-null annotation of non-book.

06:22.830 --> 06:28.220
So we're doing that what I'm going to do is simply say no no.

06:28.260 --> 06:33.700
From Lombok and if I do that and install my project again

06:39.890 --> 06:45.460
we're now seeing that the set name it has if name it calls no.

06:45.500 --> 06:53.120
And then Crose some new in null pointer exception and otherwise it's simple setting the name longbows.

06:53.140 --> 07:00.800
And it's Annotations are cool and great ways to improve your code and get rid of lots of boilerplate.

07:01.300 --> 07:07.270
Otherwise you have to be taking a couple of minutes and even more depending on the number of your properties

07:07.630 --> 07:11.370
to write down all these boilerplate codes.

07:11.470 --> 07:18.400
So I highly encourage you to check out the lumber plug in and other alternatives other annotations that

07:18.400 --> 07:20.170
you can use within your projects.
