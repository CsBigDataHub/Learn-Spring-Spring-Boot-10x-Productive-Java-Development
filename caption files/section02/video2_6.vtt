In order to install intelligent on Mac OS we first have to go to intelligent com

00:13.180 --> 00:15.040
and click Intel AJ

00:19.090 --> 00:22.760
click download.

00:22.960 --> 00:25.240
You have two options here.

00:25.360 --> 00:34.580
First there's the community one which is a reduced ID and you have the ultimate one which is the most

00:34.580 --> 00:37.780
capable ID you can find on the market.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.530
In my projects I use the ultimate one so I'll download this one

00:45.700 --> 00:50.430
and it already started downloading OK.

00:50.570 --> 00:53.160
It's complete.

00:53.240 --> 00:54.930
Now let's start the installer.

01:03.550 --> 01:07.150
All you have to do is just drag and drop their data set.
