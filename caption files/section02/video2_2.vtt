00:00.510 --> 00:06.380
In order to install Java we have to go to Oracle that come first.

00:06.390 --> 00:07.590
So now let's do that

00:12.510 --> 00:18.110

00:22.540 --> 00:23.890
Now let's click.

Joe a platform JDK.

00:29.280 --> 00:32.540
Now we have to accept the agreement here.

00:32.550 --> 00:34.380
So let's do that.

00:34.980 --> 00:41.130
And for this tutorial I'll be installing the 64 bit version of Java.

00:41.130 --> 00:49.760
So if you how 32 bit version of Windows you can install this one but I'll download this one.

00:50.050 --> 00:50.500
OK.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.010
So let's do that now.

00:53.250 --> 00:58.660
Once the download is complete you'll be prompted with the installer.

00:58.680 --> 01:08.180

01:08.180 --> 01:14.480
So when you do that click Next an installer will begin.

01:14.720 --> 01:22.760
Once the installation of JDK is complete you'll be prompted to install the Jerry so to do that click

01:22.760 --> 01:28.570

01:28.610 --> 01:31.470
Wait for it and it's finished.

01:32.180 --> 01:38.780
Now we have to verify that we have Java installed properly to do that.

01:38.780 --> 01:40.700
Now let's open a command prompt.

01:41.990 --> 01:50.600
Type ACMD and type Jawa minus version.

01:50.690 --> 01:58.850

01:58.850 --> 01:59.960
do that.

02:00.110 --> 02:09.820
Go to your computer and open properties go to advanced system settings and click and what variables

02:11.400 --> 02:14.660
you see there is no Djala home installed here.

02:16.420 --> 02:21.180
To fix that let's go to the installation directory of Java

02:25.570 --> 02:34.650
go to your computer and program files Java and JDK.

02:34.650 --> 02:48.970
Now copy the path and use it to add a Java home namely Wymans variable as Java underscore home and paste

02:48.970 --> 02:50.980
the path.

02:51.170 --> 02:56.460
Click OK and OK again.

02:56.600 --> 03:02.450
Now if you reopened this command prompt like this.

03:04.310 --> 03:08.850
