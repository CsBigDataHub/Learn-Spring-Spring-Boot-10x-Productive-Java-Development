00:00.480 --> 00:08.100
Now it's time to install the idea that we're going to use with our development which is intelligent

00:08.940 --> 00:10.210
to do that.

00:10.320 --> 00:13.270
Let's go to intelligence dot com.

00:19.360 --> 00:23.700
And of course it's the jet brains the company behind it.

00:25.550 --> 00:28.290
And click intelligencia here.

00:31.750 --> 00:34.320
And you have to download them.

00:34.720 --> 00:39.390
And in this section you have two options to community one.

00:39.420 --> 00:47.660
And the ultimate one the ultimate As you can see has all the benefits of an advance ID and on the other

00:47.660 --> 00:51.670
hand community one is lacking in some features.

00:51.710 --> 00:58.460
What I would suggest you to do is get the ultimate one so click download

01:03.870 --> 01:11.760
because as you can see it has a 30 days free trial so it's definitely worth trying.

01:11.760 --> 01:21.660
So now let's say and wait for the completion of the download when the download is complete run the installer

01:23.510 --> 01:31.220
click next and verify the output directory for your installation.

01:32.370 --> 01:33.350
And click next

01:35.940 --> 01:40.410
and you have a couple of alternatives for your installation.

01:40.860 --> 01:49.350
You can either have a 64 bit launcher or 32 bit launcher but I prefer you to choose 64 bit larger because

01:49.590 --> 01:52.290
that's what today's machines needs.

01:52.710 --> 01:58.650
And if you want you can also create file associations but it's not necessary.

01:58.650 --> 02:05.200
So let's collect next and click install.

02:05.410 --> 02:13.170
When the installation is complete select an intelligent idea and click Finish.

02:15.850 --> 02:22.280
If you have any previous version of intelligent then you can import your settings here.

02:22.420 --> 02:25.720
But if you don't and in our case we don't.

02:25.720 --> 02:36.940
So let's just collect this one and accept the policy and if you have a license for intelligent then

02:37.210 --> 02:39.440
you can use it in the section.

02:39.700 --> 02:49.240
But if you don't and you want to evaluate for free then click this one and just hit evaluate

02:52.650 --> 02:54.550
and you have to accept this one again.

02:58.800 --> 03:04.960
Here you have a couple of options for your ID preferences.

03:05.180 --> 03:13.730
So if you want to use intelligence as a default option like this or you want to use a dart team called

03:14.030 --> 03:18.900
Coola and I prefer dark one so I'll choose this one.

03:19.310 --> 03:23.730
And now let's select default plug ins in this section.

03:23.750 --> 03:27.350
Let's go and uncheck the ones that were not interested then.

03:27.470 --> 03:36.330
First of all we can disable the Android one and we can disable the Java Swing developer

03:39.370 --> 03:44.590
and since we're not developing for cloud yet we can just disable all these things.

03:47.410 --> 03:50.430
And for plugin development we don't need that too.

03:50.440 --> 03:52.290
So let's just disable that

03:56.850 --> 03:58.680
and application servers.

03:58.680 --> 04:05.550
Actually we're not going to need any application servers so we can just disable them all

04:10.110 --> 04:11.840
for vs control.

04:11.840 --> 04:14.400
We can just get rid of everything.

04:14.690 --> 04:22.790
Actually just disable them all first and have the kit and get hub OK.

04:22.920 --> 04:27.250
An we can get you know and

04:30.310 --> 04:34.960
so these options I think we are ready to go to future plug ins.

04:34.960 --> 04:40.720
There is nothing interesting here that we are going to use so let's just start using Intel A-J

04:53.860 --> 04:58.960
OK we can start using Intel was your idea to develop power applications.
