Before we start I'd like to discuss our options for ID.

00:07.100 --> 00:09.830
We have several options for ID.

00:10.040 --> 00:20.500
First we can use any of the latest eclipse with a spring plug in we can use as yes namely spin to sweat

00:21.010 --> 00:26.370
which is a custom eclipse especially for spring development.

00:26.470 --> 00:31.750
We can of course views and that means they spring module to.

00:31.900 --> 00:39.750
And finally we have intelligent idea which stands out among the Joe ideas currently on the market.

00:40.600 --> 00:46.390
It has an extensive support for spring development and has various benefits to choose it.

00:47.820 --> 00:54.660
In my personal and professional projects I prefer integers idea for its ease of use.

00:54.660 --> 01:01.540
Great tooling and support for almost any other product that you need to integrate with your software.

01:01.680 --> 01:07.750
So I'll be using intelligence along the course and develop little kid brains.

01:07.800 --> 01:13.970
The company behind Intel is doing away ultimate licenses for various users.

01:14.130 --> 01:21.100
Not only if you're a student teacher or maybe an academic person they can easily provide a license for

01:21.100 --> 01:22.620
the development needs.

01:22.950 --> 01:30.280
So while downloading intelligent please check out their website to see if you're eligible to otherwise

01:30.610 --> 01:35.110
community edition of Indonesia is perfectly fine just free to use.
