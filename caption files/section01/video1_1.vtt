Welcome to my course on spring boo I'm near zero and I'll be your instructor throughout because I'm

00:15.580 --> 00:22.270
a software engineer and I've been developing software for over 10 years currently working on spring

00:22.270 --> 00:24.460
based cloud projects.

00:24.620 --> 00:30.160
Who is the scores for this course is intended for a very wide range of audiences.

00:30.490 --> 00:36.250
JOEL Well a person with or without a spring experience is perfectly fine for his scores.

00:36.280 --> 00:41.420
So if you do not have any prior spring experience just don't worry about that.

00:41.440 --> 00:47.860
We'll go step by step and start with the fundamentals are the framework that will build on top of what

00:47.860 --> 00:48.920
we have learned.

00:49.840 --> 00:55.290
In order to talk about what we're going to color on the scores I'll see you on the next video.
