00:00.240 --> 00:03.370
Let's take an overview of what we will learn so far.

00:04.360 --> 00:11.070
As you've seen spring is an amazing framework with the features allowing dependency injection and inversion

00:11.080 --> 00:12.370
of control of the heart.

00:13.700 --> 00:15.590
You took control away to spring.

00:15.770 --> 00:20.770
And it takes care of all the wiring all the beans and managing the complexity all by itself.

00:21.840 --> 00:28.320
On the other hand Springboro sits on top of the Spring Framework as an extension of it and provides

00:28.320 --> 00:34.990
the ease of developing production grade applications for every type of task be it a complex web app

00:35.400 --> 00:42.490
an API or a web service spring boot gives you the flexibility to combine all these components together.

00:44.680 --> 00:48.510
You get the jars as the output and simply run it.

00:48.520 --> 00:56.630
That said I hope you now have the foundation of the spring world and rather to build on top of it.

00:56.650 --> 01:01.060
Now let's start by setting up our development and wireman to do that.

01:01.060 --> 01:02.430
I'll see you on the next section.
