Now let's talk about what we're going to Khowar on this course we have a lot to cover on this cause

00:10.110 --> 00:11.530
just to name a few.

00:11.690 --> 00:19.170
Spring Corps which provides the spring IOC container basically at the heart of Spring Framework itself

00:19.790 --> 00:20.900

00:21.150 --> 00:28.320
And most importantly spring and we see for developing web applications spring data for handling all

00:28.320 --> 00:36.000
sorts of data operations spring actuator which gives you of control over your application by providing

00:36.000 --> 00:38.900
useful metrics and interfaces.

00:38.910 --> 00:42.100
Subring rest for build restful API.

00:42.420 --> 00:48.910
And of course spring boot which helps you develop production grade applications without the overhead.

00:49.500 --> 00:52.730
Well we'll actually be coloring much more than these.

00:52.890 --> 00:55.340
