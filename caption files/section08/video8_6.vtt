00:01.430 --> 00:08.910
For our edit page we're going to be creating a new column in our table and then we're going to be inserting

00:08.910 --> 00:16.580
a new button there the edit button and then we can redirect our user to our edit page.

00:16.620 --> 00:25.440
So for doing that I'm going to be adding a new header to our table and then I'm saying this is the edit

00:25.440 --> 00:26.750
one.

00:26.940 --> 00:35.880
And after that I'll go to my table data and there I'm going to be providing a new button and that burden

00:36.180 --> 00:41.260
is going to be provided with the ATAC within the ATAC.

00:41.430 --> 00:46.820
I'm going to be using a th reference within that reference.

00:47.000 --> 00:56.190
I'm going to be referencing my controller my new page for our added page so that controller is going

00:56.190 --> 01:03.490
to be slash products and slash edit.

01:04.050 --> 01:12.240
And after that I'm going to be providing the ID of the producta dime selecting in the table as simply

01:12.240 --> 01:16.830
passing it to the product that I'm interested in with editing.

01:17.520 --> 01:22.430
So to say that I'm going to say product that ID.

01:22.460 --> 01:23.070
All right.

01:23.070 --> 01:24.490
Simple as that.

01:25.140 --> 01:37.420
And for the class of this ATAC I'm going to say button and button defaults All right.

01:37.530 --> 01:44.640
And of course for the text of it I'm going to be saying edit.

01:44.750 --> 01:46.570
All right.

01:46.720 --> 01:50.140
We have created our button in the UI.

01:50.470 --> 01:59.080
So now let's create our edit controller and bind it with the added button on the UI so to do that I'm

01:59.080 --> 02:05.140
going to move on to my controller and I'm going to create I renew requests mapping.

02:05.140 --> 02:11.900
So for that I'm going to copy this and go to my controller in my controller.

02:12.370 --> 02:14.510
I'm going to be having a new method.

02:14.800 --> 02:19.560
And within that method I'm going to be editing my product.

02:19.600 --> 02:30.260
So let's say that product and within that edit product method I'm going to be taking a model for UI

02:31.040 --> 02:34.870
and also I'm going to be taking a path where you will.

02:35.180 --> 02:46.390
So saying that path variable and the variable that I'm taking is going to be id so value for that is

02:46.390 --> 02:56.400
going to be ID and it's say simple string ID right in the body of my method.

02:56.590 --> 03:03.800
I'm simply going to find our product and add it to my model so that I can display in an UI.

03:03.940 --> 03:14.370
So for that I'll say model an attribute and then I'm going to add this attribute as product.

03:15.190 --> 03:26.050
And for the actual attribute I'll go to my repository and find this product with the given ID so I can

03:26.050 --> 03:34.210
say find one an ID or right and return statement.

03:34.330 --> 03:38.190
I'm going to return my editor to.

03:38.210 --> 03:45.950
So for the last part let's provide the request mapping and D-pad for the request mapping is going to

03:45.950 --> 03:47.840
be this one.

03:47.840 --> 03:52.710
And also we're going to provide the ID as the path where you will

03:55.600 --> 03:57.510
all right.

03:57.750 --> 04:05.220
So for the matter of this request we're going to be using it as a get method.

04:05.240 --> 04:23.490
We're almost done with the edit page of our product so let's rerun our application and see it in action.

04:23.560 --> 04:24.940
Our application is starting up

04:27.720 --> 04:30.110
and here we go.

04:30.240 --> 04:38.680
Our applications start at let's switch back to Firefox and refresh our page.

04:38.680 --> 04:39.570
Here we go.

04:39.670 --> 04:44.380
We have our edit button displaying in our products page.

04:44.530 --> 04:49.960
So as you can see from the you are all on the left below of the screen.

04:49.960 --> 04:54.720
We how our product with the ID in the end.

04:55.570 --> 05:05.510
So we click our edit button here we go we have our product details and they are all inserted into impled

05:05.510 --> 05:12.350
fields and we can simply type our new parameters new well use for our properties then we can simply

05:12.350 --> 05:13.170
hit say.

05:13.580 --> 05:20.640
So for the purpose of editing let's just update the price of our product to ninety nine ninety nine

05:21.020 --> 05:23.710
and see if it's updated.

05:23.750 --> 05:30.270
So all now save this product and if I go to my product page again here we go.

05:30.410 --> 05:34.880
We have our new price listed right here.

05:34.910 --> 05:41.570
So this concludes the adult section of our product in the next video we're going to be taking a look

05:41.570 --> 05:43.380
at eating our product.

05:43.460 --> 05:46.400
So to do that I'll be seeing you in the next video.
