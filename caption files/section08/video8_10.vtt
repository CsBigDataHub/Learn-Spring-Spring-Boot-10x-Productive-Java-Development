00:00.770 --> 00:06.650
Now let's take a moment to review what we learned in this section in this section.

00:06.840 --> 00:11.630
We put together everything we learn together and build a web application with it.

00:12.440 --> 00:17.900
Before that we checked out the application that we're going to build and what it will look like when

00:17.900 --> 00:18.790
we finish it.

00:20.200 --> 00:27.700
Down we started the implementation and we did it by creating the operations down re-implemented read

00:27.940 --> 00:35.030
update and delete respectively we written our model service and the controller following the.

00:35.030 --> 00:38.420
And we see pattern by doing all these.

00:38.510 --> 00:47.200
We made use of spring boot spring and we see spring Deda and spring rest on top of our application.

00:47.260 --> 00:54.700
We put a nice UI and interface that we built with a team L5 CSSA bootstrap and of course time we've

00:56.590 --> 00:58.750
it's been a great journey up until now.

00:58.840 --> 01:04.690
And this section including everything we covered combined into an application has definitely been awesome

01:04.690 --> 01:06.240
for us.

01:06.250 --> 01:12.800
We now know how all these components are brought together and how they interact internally.

01:12.810 --> 01:13.790
All right.

01:13.900 --> 01:18.140
This was a long and a real great section to combine everything we know together.

01:19.030 --> 01:27.070
And yet for this course we know how our extra is waiting for us these extras include spring deltas live

01:27.120 --> 01:36.000
reload project Lombok spring actuator swaggerer for restful documentation and much more other great

01:36.000 --> 01:40.930
tools and utilities that we can make use of in any project that we're going to develop.

01:41.190 --> 01:46.860
So if you feel you're ready to move on let's move on to our extra section and I'll be seeing you in

01:46.860 --> 01:47.390
there.
