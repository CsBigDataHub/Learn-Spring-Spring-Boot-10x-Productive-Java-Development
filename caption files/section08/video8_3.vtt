WEBVTT

00:01.410 --> 00:09.220
Know it's time that we actually start developing our web application for our web application we're going

00:09.220 --> 00:13.930
to be developing a couple of interfaces within those interfaces.

00:14.110 --> 00:18.280
We're going to be listing our products we'll be creating our products.

00:18.280 --> 00:25.720
And of course we're going to be just wheeling and editing our products before all we're going to start

00:25.720 --> 00:29.170
with our index page within our index page.

00:29.170 --> 00:33.400
We're going to be having a navigation with that navigation.

00:33.400 --> 00:41.030
We're going to be exploring all parts of our application with a single interface to make our navigation

00:41.030 --> 00:41.960
usable.

00:42.140 --> 00:48.470
We're going to have a header page DML file and within that file We're going to include everything we

00:48.470 --> 00:51.770
need for our header and navigation.

00:51.800 --> 00:58.730
So after we create our header that Tim will file then we can include it within our other pages of the

00:58.730 --> 00:59.680
application.

01:00.690 --> 01:06.760
So to start to bring our navigation and index page I'm going to first start with our header that Tim

01:06.860 --> 01:07.620
file.

01:07.770 --> 01:16.560
So to do that I'm going to create a new folder under templates and folder is going to be named as way

01:16.560 --> 01:17.130
out.

01:20.280 --> 01:27.600
And within that layout folder I'm going to be creating a new HMO file and dump file as I've said in

01:27.600 --> 01:28.470
a minute ago.

01:28.650 --> 01:29.950
It's going to be had not.

01:29.970 --> 01:33.730
H tim l within this header.

01:33.760 --> 01:34.950
A stem cell File.

01:34.960 --> 01:38.710
We're going to be designing our navigation.

01:38.750 --> 01:44.010
Let's first start with defining time we've written our header that a Tim L.

01:44.240 --> 01:53.100
So to do that I'm going to go to our team Altec and I'm going to move the language to have in a in later.

01:53.120 --> 02:01.160
So I'll say X-amount namespace and the name space is going to be referenced with Ph.

02:01.250 --> 02:12.340
And then I'm going to provide the URL of time wave and that is HTP last lash w w w time alleve

02:15.050 --> 02:16.590
dot org.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.430
All right.

02:18.560 --> 02:25.910
And after that I'm going to move wanty had section and there I'm going to say the language of the page

02:25.910 --> 02:27.960
is going to be English.

02:27.990 --> 02:29.400
All right.

02:29.490 --> 02:34.360
And after that our next stop is the med attack within this medtech.

02:34.560 --> 02:41.050
We're going to be defining the characteristics of the HTL m.p.h. within the Met attack.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.500
We're going to be saying a couple of things.

02:43.670 --> 02:47.640
First of those things is the Content-Type within the Content-Type.

02:47.750 --> 02:50.670
We're going to be providing it as a team.

02:50.840 --> 02:56.400
And we're of course going to provide our character set as UTF 8.

02:56.440 --> 03:06.880
So let's do that and then I'm going to say HTP coolant is going to be Content-Type for this matter and

03:06.880 --> 03:13.740
then I'm going to say contact is going to be tech slash T.M..

03:13.910 --> 03:20.430
And after that as you can see we have character set UTF 8 as defined for us automatically.

03:20.510 --> 03:26.810
LS also close this pack because in some browsers this can be rendered very well.

03:26.810 --> 03:29.730
So our attack would be useless.

03:29.770 --> 03:35.440
So to avoid that we're simply close and emet attack.

03:35.600 --> 03:41.050
And since this is a system and include a html file We're not going to be using any tidal.

03:41.150 --> 03:44.380
So I can simply get rid of the title right here.

03:44.450 --> 03:45.710
So let's just delete that

03:49.190 --> 03:56.210
and after that we're of course going to include some stylesheets within our application since we have

03:56.420 --> 04:04.730
nothing right now but let's say we're going to have a style that says and let's create that.

04:04.850 --> 04:12.530
So I'm going to go to this tatic part of our application and I'm going to create a new directory and

04:12.530 --> 04:20.330
that directory is going to be named Garcia says and within that directory I'm going to create a stylesheet.

04:20.370 --> 04:22.400
This is going to be named best pilots.

04:22.490 --> 04:23.710
SS All right.

04:25.050 --> 04:30.490
The content of style that CSL is empty for now but don't worry about that.

04:30.600 --> 04:35.280
We'll get back to this style CSSA file and we'll make our application look better.

04:35.280 --> 04:36.420
All right.

04:36.870 --> 04:38.600
So I'll move back to our Heather.

04:38.730 --> 04:39.880
HMO.

04:40.080 --> 04:47.800
And what I'm going to do now I'm going to reference our CSSA file and that is done by the linked back

04:48.460 --> 04:49.770
button linked back.

04:49.800 --> 04:57.870
Our relationship is going to be a stylesheet and then I'm also going to say that this is going to be

04:57.870 --> 05:01.260
used by time we've as a fallback method.

05:01.260 --> 05:04.980
So to do that I'm going to use th Tref.

05:05.380 --> 05:12.660
And within that I'm going to use this specific markdown of time leave so for doing that I'm going to

05:12.660 --> 05:19.170
use sign and then I'm going to use curly braces within those curly braces.

05:19.260 --> 05:27.740
I'm going to say that this is under CSSA and then it's going to be named as style that's ss.

05:27.780 --> 05:28.520
All right.

05:30.270 --> 05:36.950
So for our general browser purposes I'm going to also say that we're going to reference it as the all

05:36.950 --> 05:37.800
the way.

05:37.830 --> 05:45.080
So if we're doing that I'll use the Etra of TAC within the edge of Takk I will say that this is to level

05:45.180 --> 05:52.770
of all our heads not a symbol so to show you that I can move back to our navigation and within our navigation

05:52.800 --> 06:00.900
if we go one level up we have our templates folder and if we go one more level up we how are static

06:01.380 --> 06:02.730
within the static.

06:02.730 --> 06:09.690
We're moving into the CSSA folder and within that pool there we have our style that CSSA.

06:09.960 --> 06:18.510
So to say that you our extra stack I'm going to use double dots and then slash double dots and then

06:18.510 --> 06:29.400
static Obus be have one more slashes and after that I'm going to say C Ss and as you can see Intel is

06:29.730 --> 06:34.140
automatically understanding what I'm trying to say and I'll hit enter.

06:34.230 --> 06:36.140
And here we go.

06:36.150 --> 06:37.150
All right.

06:37.470 --> 06:44.040
So let's close this stack too because as I said minutes ago some browsers can understand that if you're

06:44.040 --> 06:48.220
trying to provide a tag or nothing at all.

06:48.270 --> 06:54.920
So now it's time we moved to our buddy section of our application within the body section.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.190
I'm going to provide a couple of divisions and navigation.

06:59.400 --> 07:04.790
So for doing that are moving to do our body tag within the body attack.

07:04.840 --> 07:10.200
I'll start with a division within that division.

07:10.330 --> 07:14.270
I'm going to create a fragment with a division again

07:17.830 --> 07:27.360
so the fragment is going to be set as th fragment fragment is going to indicate that I'm trying to provide

07:27.390 --> 07:31.390
a header for our application.

07:31.860 --> 07:40.740
So if I moved down a bit in the hierarchy I'm going to say that I'm actually providing a navigation

07:40.860 --> 07:46.210
to the application so I'll use now Takk for our header.

07:46.290 --> 07:54.510
And within that Natak I'm also going to create a division within that doing that will actually be having

07:54.540 --> 07:59.330
our buttons or actions for navigation.

07:59.350 --> 08:08.800
So to make it real I'm going to provide another Dev and within that Deb I'm also going to provide another

08:08.800 --> 08:13.250
div so that we can easily manage our divisions individually

08:15.780 --> 08:22.640
within this that I'm actually start providing our navigation the first part of our navigation is going

08:22.640 --> 08:30.110
to be our home button which is like the logo of your application the logo that you see within almost

08:30.140 --> 08:31.900
every Web page.

08:32.030 --> 08:41.150
So I'm going to provide it as an A within the ATAC I'm going to reference our home page which is going

08:41.150 --> 08:51.260
to be referenced as the shark character and then I'm going to use a simple HSF track of time leave within

08:51.260 --> 08:52.670
that x ray tech.

08:52.880 --> 08:57.570
I'm going to say this is going to be referencing to our home page.

08:57.590 --> 09:00.140
And it's like is untimely.

09:00.470 --> 09:06.770
And then of course I'm going to say which web page it's going to be displaying as a text.

09:07.130 --> 09:15.290
And I'm going to be displaying it at home right after I finish our home button and I'm going to go to

09:15.290 --> 09:18.530
our other parts of navigation.

09:18.530 --> 09:24.500
We're going to be having two more buttons in our navigation and those navigation buttons are going to

09:24.500 --> 09:29.070
be provided with an ordered list pack for an ordered list.

09:29.090 --> 09:34.470
We're using the you all tag or h t m l within the Haq.

09:34.910 --> 09:38.610
I'm going to be providing two elements.

09:39.890 --> 09:49.880
First of those elements is going to be provided with a and within that a I'm going to say again th reference

09:50.900 --> 09:57.060
within that th reference I'm going to provide the you are out and I'm going to use for my application.

09:57.560 --> 10:07.430
So to do that I'm going to say this is going to be linked as Slash products and of course I'm going

10:07.430 --> 10:12.610
to be naming this page as products.

10:12.650 --> 10:14.860
All right.

10:14.890 --> 10:21.280
And after that I'm going to provide another list element and within that element I'm going to provide

10:21.370 --> 10:34.790
another ATAC within that ATAC I'm again reference this page as th ref and then products slash add.

10:34.840 --> 10:35.960
All right.

10:36.370 --> 10:42.760
And then of course I'm going to name this page as create product

10:46.650 --> 10:54.440
OK we're done with our basic navigation after our no EDITION I'm going to be providing a text and an

10:54.450 --> 11:01.430
image right below that and this is all going to be placed right below our navigation.

11:01.510 --> 11:08.520
So for doing that I'm going to go down to our navigation and after that I'm going to be providing and

11:08.520 --> 11:11.240
not a division.

11:11.460 --> 11:20.040
And within that division I'm going to be providing a couple of divisions too so that we can easily manage

11:20.280 --> 11:21.640
those divisions.

11:23.180 --> 11:28.860
And after that I'm going to provide a a two TAC text.

11:28.910 --> 11:31.300
The two is Heather level two.

11:31.400 --> 11:35.640
So it's going to be large enough to see when we open our application.

11:36.140 --> 11:40.760
So within that text I'm going to say spring and we see application

11:44.890 --> 11:53.530
and after that I'm going to go down to our second Dev and then I'm going to provide another depth so

11:53.530 --> 11:58.210
that we can provide an image to our application.

11:58.210 --> 12:00.220
So I'll say dev.

12:01.120 --> 12:07.720
And within that I'm going to provide the image tech within the image stack.

12:07.750 --> 12:14.740
I'm going to use an image that I've downloaded over the Internet and that image is simply a spring Lego

12:14.740 --> 12:16.040
image.

12:16.250 --> 12:22.890
So for holding that image which in our application I'm going to create another folder and that folder

12:22.890 --> 12:27.730
is going to be under resources with them there.

12:27.780 --> 12:35.070
I'm going to create another directory and that directory is going to be named as images within that

12:35.110 --> 12:36.400
images folder.

12:36.540 --> 12:41.510
I'm going to move the image did-I downloaded over to Internet.

12:41.640 --> 12:48.380
So let me bring that up and I'm moving it to the images folder.

12:48.420 --> 12:52.320
Let me fix the navigation of this image folder.

12:52.750 --> 12:58.810
That's going to be placed right below the static for there so I'll hit OK.

13:00.050 --> 13:00.680
And

13:04.190 --> 13:07.830
let's leaked that one because we don't need it anymore.

13:09.220 --> 13:10.520
And here we go.

13:10.810 --> 13:15.600
We have our image right below the images folder.

13:15.620 --> 13:18.890
So now it's time that we actually referenced it.

13:19.040 --> 13:24.270
So the reverend said we're again going to go to levels a ball.

13:24.290 --> 13:33.920
So for doing that I'm going to use two dots slashes and then I'm going to say static and then images

13:34.610 --> 13:43.160
and the image name that I provided as per adult Jawa spring logo and of course since this is a big image

13:43.670 --> 13:52.210
I'm going to shrink down it's a little bit and I'm going to say it's going to be 30 percent large.

13:52.220 --> 13:55.130
All right.

13:55.150 --> 14:03.870
And also we're going to say that time we can understand this image at its own included within its contacts.

14:03.880 --> 14:08.510
So for doing that I'm going to use th's horse tack.

14:08.740 --> 14:19.030
So for that ph source stack I'm going to go down a little bit and then ph source is going to be at and

14:19.030 --> 14:22.390
curly braces and then images

14:25.140 --> 14:33.710
and pubertal And let's just copy the name of our image and we can move on from there.

14:36.760 --> 14:37.550
Here we go.

14:39.530 --> 14:46.390
Let's close our image Takk and we're almost finished our navigation.

14:46.490 --> 14:52.140
Now let's actually create our index page and include our header within it.

14:52.290 --> 14:59.490
So to do that I'm going to go to our templates folder and create our new Tim old file and it's going

14:59.490 --> 15:09.300
to be named as index that HMO and for the structure of it we have a little bit of a problem let's fix

15:09.360 --> 15:12.910
our structure of the index HMO file.

15:12.990 --> 15:19.910
I'm going to refactoring it and I'm going to be moving it within that movement.

15:19.950 --> 15:21.890
I'm getting rid of the layout.

15:21.960 --> 15:24.260
And then there it is

15:29.200 --> 15:33.370
all right it's under the temples for the right away.

15:33.540 --> 15:37.810
So now we can work on our index that a stem cell file.

15:37.830 --> 15:42.630
So first I'll start off with our timely for timely.

15:42.660 --> 15:51.000
As you remember we're going to use X-amount name space and then and within that th I'm going to say

15:51.440 --> 15:54.950
HTP slash slash.

15:55.080 --> 16:01.940
W w w time we've got all week.

16:02.010 --> 16:02.820
All right.

16:03.870 --> 16:05.320
And up your debt.

16:05.520 --> 16:08.970
I'm going to just close this med attack as you can remember.

16:08.970 --> 16:16.160
Couple of minutes ago that we set some browsers can render it and after that I'm going to provide a

16:16.190 --> 16:18.920
title for our application.

16:19.010 --> 16:31.580
So this is going to be named as products spring and we see application and after that is the actual

16:31.580 --> 16:39.410
part that we're interested in and that is the header include park for doing that of first start by creating

16:39.410 --> 16:49.040
a timely block and within that timely block I'm going to say that I'll be including a a simplified to

16:49.040 --> 16:50.940
my index page T.M..

16:51.350 --> 16:57.680
So doing that I'll use th include and within that include.

16:57.770 --> 17:06.290
I'm going to say it will be under the layout folder and then it's named as header.

17:06.620 --> 17:14.300
All right now we're almost done with the basic navigation and appearance of our application.

17:14.300 --> 17:21.420
Now let's also create our controller for the index page and start serving our application from there.

17:21.800 --> 17:25.740
So for doing that I'm going to create our control class.

17:26.030 --> 17:35.600
So for that I'll create a new package and named as controller which in that controller I'm going to

17:35.600 --> 17:42.580
create a new class and it's going to be pro-law controller

17:46.140 --> 17:52.120
or controller class is going to be annotated with the simple controller annotation.

17:52.280 --> 18:00.830
And so to do that I'll go up and say this is a controller this controller will be able to search the

18:00.830 --> 18:04.800
pages of our application and the data to our users.

18:06.390 --> 18:14.560
So for our index page I'm going to create a new request mapping and for the request mapping I'm simply

18:14.560 --> 18:22.340
going to create a method returning a string and that string is going to be a stem Elf while.

18:22.470 --> 18:31.830
So for the method name I'm going to use as index and then I'll simply return our index page.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.600
Right.

18:33.900 --> 18:42.960
And in the request mapping I'm going to be navigating it as the route that so is going to be just a

18:42.960 --> 18:43.920
slash.

18:43.950 --> 18:44.550
All right.

18:46.150 --> 18:51.730
So we're almost done with our controller to serve our indexed r h t m l file.

18:52.300 --> 18:56.990
Let's run our application for the first time and see what it looks like.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.030
Our application is starting up

19:09.320 --> 19:10.470
and here we go.

19:11.890 --> 19:15.330
Let's open up Firefox and see what it looks like.

19:25.470 --> 19:29.410
Localhost eighty eighty nine.

19:32.710 --> 19:34.120
And here we go.

19:34.270 --> 19:42.580
We have a simple page with navigation and an image right below that but this doesn't look good at all

19:42.580 --> 19:43.220
right.

19:44.760 --> 19:51.390
So no it's time that we include bootstrap to our application to beautify it and have a great looking

19:51.390 --> 19:53.370
application.

19:53.410 --> 20:00.860
So for doing that I'll switch back to my ID before we start including built up into our application

20:01.600 --> 20:10.350
I should first take a moment to talk about web jar's web jobs are great ways to include CSSA javascript

20:10.410 --> 20:16.370
and other web libraries into your web application as the job away DJR files.

20:17.040 --> 20:20.450
To take a look at it I'll switch back to Firefox.

20:20.670 --> 20:25.650
And in a new tab I'll go to Web jar's

20:28.540 --> 20:37.210
and if we go to do the full page of the web jar's as you can see web jobs are defined as client side

20:37.210 --> 20:45.850
web libraries such as a query and bootstrap package into Jarre archive files and as you can see from

20:45.850 --> 20:52.000
the highlights it says explicitly an easily managed decline site dependencies in Jay re-embrace web

20:52.000 --> 20:54.160
applications.

20:54.260 --> 21:01.040
So for our bootstrap need we're going to be including the bootstraps latest version into our application

21:02.740 --> 21:03.850
so we're doing that.

21:03.880 --> 21:05.010
I'll go to do.

21:05.110 --> 21:06.590
And we are a repository

21:11.560 --> 21:19.880
and then I'm going to be looking at the bootstrap web or.

21:20.090 --> 21:22.060
And we have it.

21:22.070 --> 21:29.290
So let's take a look at it and we have Creedle 3.7 Dash 1 as the latest version.

21:29.540 --> 21:39.040
And I'm simply going to take the dependency and switch back to my ID now and then I'll go to my Palm

21:39.040 --> 21:44.620
file and include it.

21:44.680 --> 21:45.940
And here we go.

21:51.250 --> 21:57.440
Let's enable the auto import and maybe we can download it over to internet.

21:57.440 --> 21:58.170
All right.

21:58.190 --> 21:59.100
It's already done.

22:01.390 --> 22:07.500
So now let's switch back to our heads up as to your mail and include bootstrap into our application

22:09.430 --> 22:10.640
for doing that.

22:10.660 --> 22:16.280
I'm going to be adding a link to Jack within that linked back.

22:16.310 --> 22:20.090
We're going to be referencing bootstrap to our application.

22:20.090 --> 22:29.330
So for doing that I'm going to be using th Tref within that ph as SRF I'm going to be saying Webb jar

22:31.160 --> 22:42.640
and of course we have to be using the slash before it and then I'm going to say bootstrap and then I'm

22:42.650 --> 22:45.200
providing the version of it.

22:45.430 --> 22:54.050
This is going to be $3.3 7 Dash 1 and then I'll say See assess and bootstrap

22:57.690 --> 23:01.200
dot men that's VSS.

23:01.300 --> 23:02.760
All right.

23:02.870 --> 23:08.810
And also I'm going to be referencing the web version of the unified bootstraps VSS.

23:09.140 --> 23:15.670
So for doing that I'm going to be using the actual Atra stack within that extra deck.

23:15.680 --> 23:22.850
I already copy the location of our CSSA the minute flight version and I'm simply going to paste it right

23:22.850 --> 23:23.770
here.

23:23.900 --> 23:32.990
So this is going to be acting as the fallback for RC SS if the web job somehow fails to load RC SS and

23:32.990 --> 23:41.540
after that I'm of course going to be providing the relation and within that relation I'm going to be

23:41.540 --> 23:47.750
saying that this is a stylesheet.

23:47.900 --> 23:48.980
All right.

23:48.980 --> 23:56.280
And then I'm going to be providing an extra attack which is media with this media attack bootstrap is

23:56.520 --> 24:04.860
going to apply its own rules sets of CSSA within any kind of interface be a mobile phone tablet desktop

24:05.220 --> 24:06.260
whatever.

24:06.270 --> 24:15.600
If we say screeding which can navigate itself and any web page and it displaying DeWyze so I'll also

24:15.600 --> 24:16.820
close this tag.

24:17.340 --> 24:24.000
And then I'm going to start by adding the classes for bootstrap to our navigation so that to make them

24:24.000 --> 24:33.190
beautiful so now go down to our division tax and first I'm going to say the first division is going

24:33.190 --> 24:42.220
to be a container container class indicates that this division is containing lots of other attacks including

24:42.230 --> 24:44.320
additives to.

24:44.360 --> 24:52.470
So right after that I'm going to go to our navigation and within that navigation I'm going to use to

24:52.490 --> 25:03.360
know bar classes or bootstrap and I'm going to also say this is a default now or and after that I'm

25:03.360 --> 25:12.170
going to go to other dev and say that this is a container and it's say Flude 1.

25:12.210 --> 25:19.520
So this Flude one says are contained elements can be adjusted as we want.

25:19.530 --> 25:29.250
So after our vision I'll move on to our next division and I'm going to say this is going to be the harder

25:29.250 --> 25:40.250
part or we're now bar so I'll say no bar Desch header and for our homework I'm going to be providing

25:40.280 --> 25:48.320
a special task special class and that class is going to be no bar Brant as you can understand from the

25:48.320 --> 25:52.910
name this is going to be the main burden of our application.

25:52.910 --> 26:00.350
So you're probably going to put a logo for your website but for our case our home button is going to

26:00.350 --> 26:08.430
be a little bit different from other navigation buttons in our UI and after our home button I'm moving

26:08.430 --> 26:13.150
on to our on order list in our on order at last.

26:13.290 --> 26:15.300
I'm going to be using the now.

26:15.780 --> 26:18.630
And now we are now tax

26:21.800 --> 26:33.950
right and within our other Dave right below I'm going to be providing a special tag again and that tag

26:34.110 --> 26:42.770
is going to be Jumbotron Jumbotron Ptak indicates that you have some important content within that division.

26:43.880 --> 26:48.930
So it highlights it and makes it clear that you have something important there.

26:50.400 --> 26:59.280
And the division after that I'm going to be providing world class and then it's going to be centered

26:59.340 --> 27:07.830
text and a deal before the age to tack on going to providing the rope again so that it can be adjusted

27:08.370 --> 27:10.650
as a role in the UI.

27:12.200 --> 27:21.500
And after that I'll move on to my image and the division that holding the image is going to be named

27:21.500 --> 27:31.290
as Ro and tech center so that the image can be displayed on the center of the web page.

27:31.310 --> 27:32.600
All right.

27:32.600 --> 27:37.400
No we can rerun our application and see the changes in effect.

27:37.670 --> 27:42.450
So to do that I'm going to rerun our application and see what's going to happen.

27:45.760 --> 27:50.460
Our application is starting up now.

27:50.710 --> 27:54.700
And here we have it.

27:54.770 --> 27:56.760
Now let's go to Firefox again.

27:56.990 --> 28:08.360
And if you go to localhost A.D. 89 and here we go we have much more of a clean and a beautiful Web page

28:09.010 --> 28:13.140
and within that web page you should notice couple of things.

28:13.310 --> 28:19.260
We have our navigation right arrow and it's on the top of our Web page.

28:19.370 --> 28:26.740
And as you know there's our now our brand Clast home button is a little bit bigger than the other buttons.

28:26.960 --> 28:36.300
And we also have our products and create product buttons with some style and right after our navigation

28:36.690 --> 28:38.940
we have a jumbotron.

28:39.060 --> 28:44.320
As I've said this is a clear separation from other parts of the UI.

28:44.430 --> 28:52.050
It's highlighted with gray by default and we have our spring and we see application and our spring logo

28:52.260 --> 28:55.440
center into our web page.

28:55.540 --> 29:03.150
Now we've created the initial page of our application in navigation and another content right below

29:03.150 --> 29:03.590
it.

29:04.410 --> 29:09.240
So to me all with create product page I'll be seeing you in the next video.
