00:00.390 --> 00:01.510
All right.

00:01.590 --> 00:07.600
We've now finished the development of our full fledged spring and with secret application.

00:07.680 --> 00:13.740
So as we always did at the end of any chapter now is your turn to create a create application of your

00:13.740 --> 00:16.880
own for such application.

00:16.880 --> 00:23.060
You first need to lay out the components and design considerations for those elements and you're ready

00:23.060 --> 00:24.020
to develop.

00:24.020 --> 00:29.090
Start with the fundamental pieces of your software and then build on top of it.

00:29.150 --> 00:36.320
I highly encourage you to try out all the different components that we have seen up until now and make

00:36.320 --> 00:43.580
sure that you use them in your application to before you begin either use and modify the application

00:43.580 --> 00:49.090
that I've shared with the on the Get up dot com or much better start from scratch.

00:49.100 --> 00:50.370
It's all up to you.

00:50.750 --> 00:51.430
Wow.

00:51.560 --> 00:55.110
It's been a great journey and I bet you don't want this to end.

00:55.900 --> 01:02.150
We have of course a lot of extras coming to you in the next section and in the next section you'll see

01:02.150 --> 01:09.370
some of the hand-picked utilities that you should definitely make use of in your applications on projects.

01:09.430 --> 01:16.270
I hope you do well on your exercise and if you're ready to move on let's take an overview of the section

01:16.390 --> 01:17.660
in the next video.
