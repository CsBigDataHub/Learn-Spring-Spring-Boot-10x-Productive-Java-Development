00:00.730 --> 00:06.730
We're now on a great milestone of our spring and spring ball journey we'll start building ourselves

00:06.790 --> 00:14.250
a full featured springboard and with secret application while Deuel hoping this application will be

00:14.250 --> 00:18.100
making use of all the awesome technologies that we learned along the way.

00:19.290 --> 00:26.910
These technologies include spring boot spring NBC spring rest spring data and this time will actually

00:26.910 --> 00:33.840
be developing ourselves a web application so I'll also be using a Steimle five CSSA 3 bootstrap and

00:33.840 --> 00:36.010
much more.

00:36.150 --> 00:42.270
By the end of the section you'll understand how everything works together and how you can get the maximum

00:42.270 --> 00:49.130
value out of all these building blocks in any application that you're going to build enough talking.

00:49.140 --> 00:55.020
And let's take a look at what we're going to be building and what it's going to look like when we finish

00:55.020 --> 00:57.120
our development.

00:57.250 --> 01:01.930
So I'll switch back to Firefox.

01:02.100 --> 01:09.370
And here we have the application we're going to be building this application as we just talked in a

01:09.370 --> 01:10.690
minute ago.

01:10.780 --> 01:15.780
There's going to be a spring and we see application with this application.

01:15.940 --> 01:23.620
We're going to be developing ourselves an interface a UI that UI we're going to be managing our products

01:23.860 --> 01:28.090
from an interface within that interface.

01:28.160 --> 01:35.550
We can list all the products that we have and we can add new products to our inventory to our repository.

01:35.560 --> 01:39.040
So let's take out our application and navigate around it.

01:39.990 --> 01:44.410
In the navigation bar we're going to have three sections.

01:44.520 --> 01:50.460
The first one is the home section which redirects us back to this interface.

01:50.460 --> 01:56.700
And the second button we have is the products and if we click the products button we're going to be

01:56.790 --> 02:00.300
having all the products display it from our repository.

02:00.300 --> 02:08.850
As you can see here and in the right hand side of the products table that we have here we have the button

02:08.940 --> 02:10.460
and the edit button.

02:10.590 --> 02:18.950
If we go to our button we're going to be shown the details of our product and if we go back and check

02:18.950 --> 02:27.760
out the edit button we're going to be able to edit our product in our repository and we can then simply

02:27.760 --> 02:37.080
say our edited product and the last functionality that we're going to have is the create product functionality.

02:37.080 --> 02:44.450
And if we go to create section we'll do it this way with the new product screen that we can add our

02:44.450 --> 02:47.120
new product with the data that we provide.

02:48.590 --> 02:52.970
This is the application that we're going to be building in the section.

02:53.130 --> 02:59.700
And as I discussed before we're going to be using a lot of different technologies and see how they work

02:59.700 --> 03:00.940
together.

03:01.020 --> 03:05.190
So to start building our application I'll be seeing you on the next video.
