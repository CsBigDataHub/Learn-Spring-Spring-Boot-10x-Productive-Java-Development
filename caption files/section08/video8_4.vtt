WEBVTT

00:01.260 --> 00:09.150
As you remember from our previous video for our create product page we said that we're going to be looking

00:09.150 --> 00:17.580
for the reference slash products slash ad and that's going to be sobering point for our create product

00:17.580 --> 00:18.810
page.

00:18.810 --> 00:22.910
So to do that let's start off with creating our controller.

00:23.310 --> 00:32.680
So I'll copy this path and I'll move on to my controller and within the controller I'm going to create

00:32.740 --> 00:39.400
a new request mapping and the path of that request mapping is going to be this one.

00:39.440 --> 00:47.650
And of course I'm going to be using the get method for that request mapping and after that I'm going

00:47.650 --> 00:51.830
to say this is going to be the create product at

00:56.140 --> 01:06.350
and as the injection I'm going to be taking a UI model from spring and we see so that I can return an

01:06.590 --> 01:11.200
empty model empty product model to my interface.

01:11.200 --> 01:20.540
So for doing that I'm going to say I need a new attribute and that attribute is going to be named as

01:20.690 --> 01:28.280
product and then I'm simply going to say I'm returning a new product.

01:28.340 --> 01:29.400
All right.

01:30.200 --> 01:34.720
And after that I'll actually return the web page that I'm interested in.

01:35.460 --> 01:41.580
For our create product page we're actually going to be sharing that interface with the added product

01:41.580 --> 01:42.900
page.

01:42.900 --> 01:49.380
So 40 asked him M-file I'm going to simply create a single page him I'll file and then I'm going to

01:49.380 --> 01:53.550
use that with the new page and the edit page.

01:53.550 --> 02:00.860
So for doing that I'll go to my templates folder and I'm going to create a new ways to him L5.

02:01.380 --> 02:04.230
And I'm simply going to name it as added.

02:04.270 --> 02:05.040
H t m l

02:07.780 --> 02:12.660
within that HMO file I'll start off with the timely namespace.

02:12.670 --> 02:29.610
So for doing that again SML namespace and th Then HTP w w w dot time we've got or write and after that

02:29.970 --> 02:34.700
I'm going to say the language is going to be English.

02:34.800 --> 02:38.180
I already have the Met attack and my other pages.

02:38.250 --> 02:41.680
So I'm simply getting rid of this in here.

02:42.330 --> 02:49.010
And after that I'll say the title of my page is going to be added product details.

02:49.020 --> 02:50.460
All right.

02:50.850 --> 02:56.910
And the other crucial part of our application is to include our header that age to mail.

02:57.000 --> 03:05.700
So for doing that I'm going to create a new block from time we've.

03:05.850 --> 03:10.320
And within that block I'm going to use de-th include Ptak

03:15.260 --> 03:18.110
and within that Keech include tech.

03:18.230 --> 03:28.420
I'm going to provide the header that a Steimle way out slash header.

03:28.890 --> 03:35.100
And actually we missed a part in our link for time namespace.

03:35.220 --> 03:42.140
So to fix that I'll add my backslashes and here we go.

03:42.150 --> 03:48.440
Now let's move on to the body part of our application and provide the details of our product.

03:49.880 --> 03:54.950
I'll start by creating a new division within that equation.

03:54.980 --> 04:05.030
I'm going to be using the container class and inside that division I'll first say I'll use a a two header

04:05.360 --> 04:11.100
and within that header I'm going to say edit product details.

04:13.180 --> 04:21.810
After that attack I'm actually going to provide the product details table this table is going to be

04:22.350 --> 04:24.490
shaped as a form.

04:24.600 --> 04:28.320
So within that I'm going to create a new form

04:32.600 --> 04:43.080
and for the form I'm going to be using the form horizontal will trap class.

04:43.150 --> 04:44.570
Let's fix that.

04:45.880 --> 04:53.470
And the object that I'm going to be using within this form is the product object that returning from

04:53.470 --> 04:55.520
our request mapping.

04:55.550 --> 05:04.490
It's just one so let's reference it with a T-H object within that object.

05:04.600 --> 05:12.300
I'm going to provide dollar and then curly braces and product.

05:12.400 --> 05:21.200
All right after that I'm going to be providing the action for this form and the action that the form

05:21.200 --> 05:27.120
is going to take when we submit this form is going to be products endpoint.

05:27.350 --> 05:41.710
So to say that I'm going to say th action is going to be at and kill the braces slash products.

05:41.900 --> 05:47.550
So you should notice that this products end point is going to be a POS standpoint.

05:47.600 --> 05:53.960
And let's also say the method that we're going to use and the method that we're going to use as I said

05:53.990 --> 05:57.030
a minute ago as post.

05:57.290 --> 06:06.470
All right within our forum I'll start by creating another division and that division is going to be

06:06.560 --> 06:09.320
a form group.

06:09.320 --> 06:18.870
So that was Rapkin group my form elements and within the group I'm going to use the bootstraps.

06:18.980 --> 06:29.200
Another beautiful way of Gretz I'll say this is going to be small medium column with the tent size of

06:29.200 --> 06:32.450
an element.

06:32.670 --> 06:39.320
For more details on which rap styles I definitely encourage you to check out their web page.

06:39.390 --> 06:45.970
They have greater Tauriel and sources so that you can learn and understand bootstrap deeply so far our

06:45.970 --> 06:54.940
first element in our Form I'm going to provide an input within that input I'm going to provide it's

06:54.950 --> 06:58.270
time as hidden.

06:58.910 --> 07:05.720
This is going to be our ID field so we don't actually need to see when we create a new product.

07:05.810 --> 07:14.150
And after that I'm going to say this is a form control for the actual field that we're going to use

07:14.410 --> 07:15.620
with this element.

07:15.620 --> 07:27.010
Is th field so that one is going to be Asterix and curly braces ID.

07:27.060 --> 07:35.970
All right let's close our input tack and move on with our next element for our next element.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.710
As you can guess from now we're going to provide another form group

07:43.380 --> 07:45.070
within our group.

07:45.180 --> 07:53.820
We're not going to provide a label and the first property of our product class is the name so for a

07:53.820 --> 08:03.990
name we're going to first start by providing the class that's going to be called S-M 2 and then I'm

08:03.990 --> 08:06.800
also going to provide another class here.

08:06.900 --> 08:10.600
It's going to be control and label.

08:11.040 --> 08:19.820
This is going to be indicating that this is a label and it's a control element and for the text of this

08:19.820 --> 08:24.460
element I'm going to say name all right

08:28.360 --> 08:35.740
for the input text of this label the element right next to it is going to be and in fulfilled.

08:35.760 --> 08:42.390
So to hold that input field I'm going to provide another division within that division I'm going to

08:42.390 --> 08:53.470
say call S.M. and 10 and right in that division I'll provide my input field to Type of this input field

08:53.470 --> 09:06.080
is going to be taxed and the class that I'm going to use is again from control let's fix our form.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.930
Here we go.

09:07.930 --> 09:16.590
And after that I'm going to be providing the field that I'm going to use sort of field is going to be

09:17.220 --> 09:23.310
Asterix and description.

09:23.310 --> 09:24.520
All right.

09:25.140 --> 09:29.830
Let's close our task and move on with our next element.

09:31.410 --> 09:35.310
For our next element I'm going to create another.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.980
And declasse as you know by now is going to be a form group

09:45.600 --> 09:54.190
that I'm going to start by creating a label and this field is going to be for Type of our product.

09:54.410 --> 09:59.420
So I'll say class call S-M 2.

09:59.570 --> 10:10.490
And then the other class that I'm going to be providing is control and waybill.

10:10.530 --> 10:11.300
All right.

10:13.480 --> 10:24.440
So I'm going to say detax is type and then I'll provide a division to hold my input within that division

10:24.980 --> 10:36.140
I'm going to say the class is going to be call S.M. and 10 within that division I'm going to be providing

10:36.140 --> 10:46.170
my input as type text and then class is going to be form control

10:50.970 --> 11:04.440
the field that I'm going to be referencing for this element yes th field Asterix and type Let's close

11:04.460 --> 11:09.460
our input tech and move on with the next element of our form.

11:10.800 --> 11:16.340
Our next element is the category for our category.

11:16.520 --> 11:18.740
I'm starting a new division.

11:18.740 --> 11:23.330
So that equation is going to be classed as form group

11:26.560 --> 11:27.790
within that day.

11:28.080 --> 11:39.730
I'm going to provide another label and that label is going to be classed as call S.M. and 2 for addition.

11:39.820 --> 11:48.730
I'm going to say this is going to be also classed with control waybill and for the text of this label

11:49.180 --> 11:55.280
I'm going to be providing category.

11:55.300 --> 11:56.040
All right.

11:58.050 --> 12:06.990
Let's also create another dare to hold our input and A-class for that there is going to be called S

12:06.990 --> 12:10.980
M and 10 within that there.

12:11.380 --> 12:22.150
I'm going to be providing the input and the type of that input is going to be text declasse that I'm

12:22.150 --> 12:33.850
going to use as for them dash control and the actual field I'm referencing what this input element is

12:34.060 --> 12:37.270
going to be Asterix and

12:39.920 --> 12:42.880
category.

12:42.950 --> 12:43.480
All right

12:47.180 --> 12:48.500
what else do we have.

12:48.500 --> 12:51.780
We have price left for our form.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.390
So that's great.

12:53.390 --> 13:04.610
Our final division and division again is going to be a form group within that division.

13:04.610 --> 13:14.100
I'm going to be providing a label again and declasse for that label is going to be call S-M 2 and also

13:14.330 --> 13:20.410
provide the control label Takk for the text.

13:20.600 --> 13:24.030
I'm willing to say this is price.

13:24.710 --> 13:34.870
And for our input I'm creating another div and the class for that call is 10 written that day.

13:35.100 --> 13:46.010
I'm going to provide an input as type of text and the class for that input is going to be from control

13:48.590 --> 14:03.600
the actual field to them referencing for that input is going to be Asterix and price right.

14:03.630 --> 14:05.570
We're almost done with our form.

14:05.790 --> 14:14.120
But before we finish we should provide a submit button for our form that our users can create new products.

14:14.580 --> 14:21.970
So to do that I'll create another day right below that one and I'm going to put a button inside it.

14:23.300 --> 14:30.350
So for that day I'm going to also use form group class and

14:33.010 --> 14:42.550
inside that div I'm going to have another day and provide it as call S-M to

14:45.340 --> 14:47.140
INSIDE MY FINAL DAY.

14:47.770 --> 14:57.220
I'm going to say I want a button and the type of guy pudden is going to be submit and declasse for it

14:57.500 --> 15:05.250
is going to be button and Button primary.

15:05.280 --> 15:09.530
So for the name of that palm I'm going to use save.

15:10.020 --> 15:11.570
All right.

15:11.690 --> 15:19.280
We're almost finished with our create product page but to actually how we're working we should be exposing

15:19.280 --> 15:20.570
a new endpoint.

15:20.720 --> 15:27.900
As we said earlier and this is the slash product standpoint this is going to be posted.

15:27.950 --> 15:35.120
This forum is going to be posted to that end point and then we can create our product in our database.

15:36.070 --> 15:43.930
So to finish off it or create product page I'll switch back to my controller and within that controller

15:44.260 --> 15:49.930
I'll first say I'm going to be returning the added page.

15:49.930 --> 15:59.510
All right so that controller can refer us back to our create product pitch for the actual creation of

15:59.570 --> 16:00.860
our product.

16:00.920 --> 16:09.770
I'm going to be creating a new method and that method is going to be say product get it within that

16:09.770 --> 16:11.170
same product method.

16:11.300 --> 16:19.520
I'm going to be taking a product object and with product object I can simply say that I can save this

16:19.520 --> 16:26.320
product but for doing that we should have a reference to our repository.

16:26.320 --> 16:39.730
So for doing that I'll go right up and I'll say private product repository and product repository for

16:39.730 --> 16:41.050
the injection.

16:41.260 --> 16:46.170
I'll create a setter and then I'm simply going to order it.

16:46.560 --> 16:48.440
All right.

16:48.550 --> 16:57.670
For our product repository I'll say product repository save and pass the product from our UI to our

16:57.670 --> 16:58.550
method.

16:58.900 --> 17:00.250
All right.

17:00.250 --> 17:05.030
In the end I'll be redirecting our users to our index page.

17:05.110 --> 17:17.330
So for doing that I'll use return and direct and then I'll simply say slash for the actual request mapping.

17:17.360 --> 17:26.550
Let's go up to our Methot and say request mapping is going to be the path products.

17:27.550 --> 17:32.590
And the method that we're going to use is toast.

17:32.620 --> 17:34.450
All right.

17:34.940 --> 17:39.870
We're almost done with creating our product to see it in action.

17:39.890 --> 17:54.520
Let's read on our application and see what's going on.

17:54.610 --> 18:04.100
Our applications started up and let's switch back to Firefox and refresh our page.

18:04.110 --> 18:12.610
All right now let's click Create product page in create product page as we expect it.

18:12.620 --> 18:21.020
We have our added product details as you can see here with the labels on the left and import tax on

18:21.020 --> 18:21.990
the right.

18:22.220 --> 18:25.530
And we also have the same one right below.

18:26.090 --> 18:32.250
So let's create a new product with our new web page for that product.

18:32.390 --> 18:39.430
I'm going to say great product for description.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.960
This is a great product

18:45.070 --> 18:55.630
and for this category I'm going to say greatness and the price is going to be 10.

18:55.640 --> 18:57.390
All right.

18:57.640 --> 19:02.860
Now let's say our product and see it within our repository.

19:02.860 --> 19:12.040
So I'll hit say and as you can see our application redirected us to our index page.

19:12.050 --> 19:16.450
Now let's check out our new product in our repository.

19:16.510 --> 19:25.400
So for doing that I'm going to open up a new tab and that tap I'm going to go to my H-2 database localhost

19:25.600 --> 19:27.830
1889 slash to

19:30.790 --> 19:41.840
and now this connect to our database in our database if we select our product table we have three products.

19:42.220 --> 19:48.200
And as you can see we sell our product in our repository.

19:48.330 --> 19:55.960
So that concludes our create product page for the implementation of listing products.

19:56.070 --> 19:57.740
I'll be seeing you in the next video.
