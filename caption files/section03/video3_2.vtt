00:08.800 --> 00:15.800
This with you what I want to do is show you more about spring initialiser.

00:15.830 --> 00:26.100
So now let's just click Create new project and there we have spring initialiser spring initialiser is

00:26.100 --> 00:30.000
a very very convenient way to create spring applications.

00:30.030 --> 00:37.910
Since spring Butte spring initialiser has all the dependencies listed in its interface so that you can

00:37.910 --> 00:45.410
just check and include in your project but how things work with that as we cowered in the previous video.

00:45.440 --> 00:52.420
You define your JDK and you say your services are out but you don't have to do anything about.

00:52.460 --> 00:59.180
This is already provided by spring and Intel AJ for when we click next.

00:59.180 --> 01:05.870
As you can see subring initialiser is retrieving options for us how it does that.

01:05.990 --> 01:14.120
To understand it more let's just go to do you are al that spring initialiser is using and understand

01:14.120 --> 01:16.470
what's going on behind the scenes.

01:16.940 --> 01:28.780
OK so I'm just going to open up my browser and let's go to start dot sprinklered IO as you can see we

01:28.780 --> 01:31.960
have a web interface for spring initialiser.

01:32.080 --> 01:38.850
It's basically a restful API that you can query to create spring application templates isn't that great.

01:39.070 --> 01:47.870
And what Intel does calls this you r l calls respites API to create the project that you desire.

01:47.890 --> 01:51.400
So let's just take a look how it works like here.

01:51.550 --> 01:58.980
You can choose to create either a Grettel or Mavin project and you can specify the spring boot version.

01:59.080 --> 02:04.260
And as we've seen before you provide other details for different kinds of projects.

02:04.270 --> 02:10.310
This is the actual dependencies part that we need with this web interface.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.840
You just type a dependency that you need.

02:12.910 --> 02:22.780
So let's say we're going to use the JPA and here we go and click to add it to your list of dependencies

02:23.290 --> 02:24.160
as you seen.

02:24.190 --> 02:31.270
This is a very basic interface we can how more options we can how advanced options with this interface

02:31.510 --> 02:35.630
so we can just go to full version just like this.

02:35.650 --> 02:43.580
You can see the packaging Java version language type and you have all the dependencies listed here.

02:43.780 --> 02:54.790
You can either go here check out the dependencies that you need and click generate a project or you

02:54.790 --> 03:02.290
can switch back to the simple version and type out the dependencies and add them to your project so

03:02.320 --> 03:04.680
you can click generate project again.

03:04.960 --> 03:10.130
Let's just create a demo project here and see what it's like to do it from here.

03:10.150 --> 03:17.030
So let's leave everything as is and click generate we have then zip file.

03:17.030 --> 03:25.760
So you extract it as you can see we have a template project we can easily include this project in intelligence

03:25.880 --> 03:27.950
and use it from there.

03:27.950 --> 03:32.090
This is another cool feature of spring initialiser.

03:32.180 --> 03:41.090
You can either use the web interface just like this or you can go to intelligent idea and use the spring

03:41.090 --> 03:47.920
initialiser from there you have two different options which are actually basically the same thing because

03:48.340 --> 03:53.660
they're using this Ural cell that's almost there is to spring initialiser.

03:53.910 --> 03:57.700
I'll see you on the next video where we talk about May 1 in general.
