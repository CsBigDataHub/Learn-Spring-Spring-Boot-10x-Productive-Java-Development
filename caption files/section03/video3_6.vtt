00:00.360 --> 00:04.910
Now let's take a moment to overview what we learned in the section up until now.

00:05.970 --> 00:12.410
In this section we have created our very first spring application to get it done.

00:12.420 --> 00:18.030
We've taken advantage of spring initialiser which helps us pick and choose what we want to include in

00:18.030 --> 00:19.820
our application very easily.

00:20.700 --> 00:28.350
We also discovered another way of creating our application and that was start at Spring Daddy-O We are

00:28.350 --> 00:34.590
taking a closer look at how to work with Mavin and how to clean install and build our application with

00:34.590 --> 00:35.060
it.

00:35.430 --> 00:39.100
And of course we're going to be using it more as we move along.

00:40.040 --> 00:46.880
With Mavin we bundled our application as a runnable Jeal file of course spring boot enabled us to do

00:46.880 --> 00:47.670
that.

00:48.140 --> 00:53.450
And finally you had an assignment to create your own spring Boot application.

00:53.450 --> 01:00.640
I hope you did well on your first application and ready to move onto the next chapter if you have any

01:00.640 --> 01:03.560
concerns or questions regarding your exercise.

01:03.640 --> 01:07.040
Please contact me about your problem and I can help you with it.

01:08.110 --> 01:14.410
To talk more on fundamentals of spring boom and the lifecycle of a typical springboard application I'll

01:14.410 --> 01:15.640
see you on the next section.
