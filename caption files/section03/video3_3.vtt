00:00.600 --> 00:07.080
Let's take an overview of what one has to offer and where it sits within our development lifecycle

00:09.640 --> 00:13.920
Maven is a build tool to manage your software builds.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.430
You can configure your build set up the way you need and and maybe takes care of running tasks on your

00:19.430 --> 00:27.370
code such as compiling testing and packaging maven manages all the dependencies you need within its

00:27.370 --> 00:28.760
Pamphile.

00:28.870 --> 00:36.330
This profile acts as the manifest of your application contains its dependencies and the boot procedure.

00:36.430 --> 00:39.240
You can add or remove dependencies easily.

00:39.580 --> 00:45.210
Version your software and how it bundled with a single line of command execution.

00:45.490 --> 00:53.140
You can add java files or name the dependencies to mavens pomme SML almost as a plain text within the

00:53.410 --> 00:57.780
dependency tag and it fetches them for you from the Mabon repository.

00:57.790 --> 01:01.600
Maybin first goes and checks for your local repository.

01:01.600 --> 01:08.050
If your dependency is not there and then it goes to the main online repository Maybin finds it there

01:08.140 --> 01:10.610
and downloads to your local repository.

01:10.640 --> 01:17.350
Then the simpler reference to your application from there as it can be seen it knows how to work with

01:17.350 --> 01:20.320
your external libraries and dependencies.

01:20.560 --> 01:23.620
No more classpath Joffe-Block club or any more.

01:23.830 --> 01:30.160
If you run made was compiled comment it first bring together all the dependency within the file and

01:30.160 --> 01:32.970
then starts the compilation with your code.

01:33.980 --> 01:41.170
Alongside to this you can run an install command or combine the two commands as mailand compile install.

01:41.180 --> 01:48.140
So Kim first compile then generate the jar archive for your application cleverly change the commands

01:48.140 --> 01:49.920
and stops execution.

01:49.940 --> 01:57.380
If the previous command fails by the help of its test command you can easily run all of your test cases

01:57.590 --> 02:03.890
with just the command typing may when tests such running them one by one and prints out the results

02:03.950 --> 02:04.710
in the end.

02:04.820 --> 02:07.810
As scamp's failures or successful ones.

02:08.630 --> 02:11.470
We now have a good amount of Norwegian Mabon.

02:11.510 --> 02:14.870
Now let's take a look at how we can build our code with MAVEN.
