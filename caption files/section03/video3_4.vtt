00:01.110 --> 00:07.610
You know how to build our application with me well let's just first open up our last project our demo

00:07.610 --> 00:08.120
project

00:19.180 --> 00:22.640
let's close the tip.

00:22.810 --> 00:32.650
And as you can see we have may we have here and this that you can see all the comments for Maybin from

00:32.680 --> 00:40.490
cleaning or project compiling testing packaging and creating all jar file.

00:40.520 --> 00:48.340
So if we go over clean and you'll see that we have lots of different options we can arrange it just

00:48.350 --> 00:52.450
command run after a rebuild or perform a rebuild.

00:52.490 --> 01:01.200
Or we can even do a custom action but for the sake of this Glorio I'm just going to run this individual

01:01.200 --> 01:02.030
command.

01:02.050 --> 01:10.150
So if you double click this command and as you can see we have a console coming up and Mavin will run

01:10.600 --> 01:15.580
clean up as you can see we have a success.

01:15.580 --> 01:17.720
This is the cleaning process with MAVEN.

01:18.280 --> 01:25.180
So Howard going to package our application to have a jar file to do that.

01:25.430 --> 01:38.370
You can run install command and just double click it.

01:38.510 --> 01:46.950
Maybe it will do it's downloading and installing some jar files some dependencies that it needs to package

01:46.950 --> 01:47.980
your application

01:59.640 --> 02:04.390
and in the end as you can see how our test results.

02:04.590 --> 02:12.990
If we had tests in our application then we would have our results within this line as if they passed

02:13.080 --> 02:15.790
or crashed or skipped.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.110
As you see with this line our focus is on packaging or application.

02:22.110 --> 02:32.400
So you can see that our job file is built and it's a success and it's installed under this directory.

02:32.400 --> 02:37.790
Also Maybin has copied our application to its repository.

02:37.950 --> 02:44.100
As you can see here so we can be a reference from our applications too.

02:44.190 --> 02:48.810
So let's just check out our job file and see what it looks like.

02:49.590 --> 02:57.930
So you'll notice that we have a target folder here which is actually we're Mavin says say use your application

02:57.930 --> 02:59.550
package.

02:59.550 --> 03:08.250
Let's check it out and see how all the sources that Mabon create it are class files palm files and other

03:08.250 --> 03:09.960
source files.

03:09.960 --> 03:13.050
You can also have your test results here.

03:13.050 --> 03:18.810
Our main focus is our application package to run this jar file.

03:18.810 --> 03:24.710
We can do a lot of different things and we can run this chart from the command line.

03:24.740 --> 03:29.510
So now let's do that and give you a good practice.

03:29.570 --> 03:31.030
Open up a command prompt.

03:31.040 --> 03:34.220
Let's go to our project directory

03:45.880 --> 03:53.220
and our project is demo and just check out the directory for and Ryke rectory.

03:53.230 --> 03:59.700
And let's just go to Target and check it out once again.

03:59.830 --> 04:00.530
Here we go.

04:00.580 --> 04:08.370
We have our char file to run this application to run this package over our application.

04:08.380 --> 04:16.300
All we have to do is say Jawa minus jar and our jar file Eurico.

04:16.360 --> 04:24.490
If we had to enter and our application will start running.

04:24.700 --> 04:25.660
Here we go.

04:25.660 --> 04:37.140
We have our application running from the command line to Erica as you can see it's really easy to clean

04:37.350 --> 04:44.160
test and package your application with maven and you have all the beauty of the command line to run

04:44.160 --> 04:45.150
your application.
