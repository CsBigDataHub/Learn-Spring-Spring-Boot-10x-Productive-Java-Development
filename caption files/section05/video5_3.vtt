00:00.400 --> 00:07.530
In this video we're going to talk about thing and template engines which are integral parts of any web

00:07.530 --> 00:15.310
application template thing is a formal avoiding repetition and providing consistent experience to your

00:15.310 --> 00:24.290
users what templating means is that for Web page that you need for specific purposes you need not create

00:24.290 --> 00:26.550
a brand new page for all of them.

00:26.680 --> 00:32.900
You need to lay out all of your components that you intend to use as plates and create temple of pages

00:32.990 --> 00:34.340
of their different needs.

00:35.170 --> 00:38.240
So let's just think of an example for one moment.

00:38.530 --> 00:43.710
Let's assume that you were his original application in this reservation application.

00:43.840 --> 00:50.470
You're going to have a user sign up Logan reservation check in and a couple of other different pages

00:50.470 --> 00:51.950
for different purposes.

00:52.240 --> 00:58.780
So a template thing you can create a sign up page with your template data structure and let it be dynamically

00:58.780 --> 01:03.380
filled with actual data whenever your user requests the page.

01:03.420 --> 01:05.990
That's the basic idea behind thing.

01:06.120 --> 01:11.670
All you have to do is to choose a template engine for this purpose and let God handle all the rendering

01:11.700 --> 01:19.500
and pay generation tasks by itself templating is an important aspect of an embassy application.

01:19.500 --> 01:25.720
So what options do we have for template thing that we can use within our applications.

01:25.900 --> 01:30.960
Considering the market share and popularity we have four different alternatives.

01:31.760 --> 01:39.550
First is the Apache will also be velocity is Rhodora and all and not a very actively maintained project

01:40.110 --> 01:41.270
in velocity.

01:41.290 --> 01:46.550
Your template code is processed however not compiled into Java code.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.540
That's basically all there is to know about it.

01:49.540 --> 01:57.180
Next up is another Apache project which is the maker it's actively being developed with the incubator

01:57.180 --> 02:03.250
of Apache Foundation and thought as a replacement for Apache will also be.

02:03.380 --> 02:10.460
We also have a newcomer which is pebble pebble is rather new to the market and offers hend of features

02:10.460 --> 02:15.270
like inheritance and easy to read syntax.

02:15.290 --> 02:19.310
The last one and the engine that we're going to use is timely.

02:19.700 --> 02:27.620
Timely is the ideal combination when developing both 4G VM and asked them all five time leave has a

02:27.620 --> 02:32.210
very very good support and Spring Framework than any other engine in the list.

02:32.300 --> 02:34.970
So that's one of the reasons why we choose it.

02:36.140 --> 02:36.890
All right.

02:37.050 --> 02:42.330
We gained a good amount of understanding on templating and template engines available for us to choose

02:42.540 --> 02:45.140
and why we prefer time against others.

02:46.360 --> 02:50.390
To talk more about timely Venger always seeing you on the next video.
