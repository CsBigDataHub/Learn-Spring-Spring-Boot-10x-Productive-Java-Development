Welcome back to spring when we see development.

00:03.330 --> 00:07.010
Before we start I should say that you come a very long way.

00:07.010 --> 00:07.980
Up until now.

00:08.130 --> 00:10.680
And a lot more great news coming ahead.

00:10.680 --> 00:12.740
You should be really proud of yourself.

00:14.630 --> 00:21.960
Now let's talk about what spring in years and what we're going to be developing before we go into details

00:21.960 --> 00:23.310
of our application.

00:23.370 --> 00:29.130
We must take a moment to discuss what we see stands for and what's the motivation behind it.

00:30.090 --> 00:34.720
And we see is actually a design pattern in software engineering principles.

00:35.040 --> 00:39.660
So what we see stands for is model we one controller.

00:39.660 --> 00:45.720
Basically it says that you are part of one application code must be separated from the underlying backend

00:45.750 --> 00:49.110
or the actual implementation.

00:49.110 --> 00:56.450
So what is and we see no am for model model is your data model in principle.

00:56.690 --> 01:02.360
Let's say that you have a reservation application and a ticket would be one of the models in the sense

01:03.850 --> 01:11.890
we we you we you as it sounds the user facing interface over application considering the similar analogy

01:11.890 --> 01:21.110
for reservation we would be a ticket purchasing interface C4 controller controller is the remaining

01:21.110 --> 01:27.590
part and is the actual implementation part of your application for a reservation application.

01:27.590 --> 01:33.150
You would have a reservation controller where you get to purchasing data from the UI and then persist

01:33.170 --> 01:35.960
it to a database.

01:35.980 --> 01:37.200
I think you get the point.

01:37.270 --> 01:38.700
And we see a pattern by now.

01:39.670 --> 01:42.920
Now we know what we see is and how it works.

01:42.940 --> 01:49.730
Now let's see what Springhill we see has to offer spring and we see is built on top of this foundation.

01:49.760 --> 01:55.970
And one of the richest and greatest components in the Spring Framework as you'll see when we start developing

01:56.390 --> 02:04.150
spring applies and we see principle very well it separates the model we would control or elegantly so

02:04.200 --> 02:08.050
we can take care of individual parts of your application independently.

02:08.580 --> 02:10.550
These are the very basics of spring.

02:10.560 --> 02:16.200
And we see so what we're going to be developing with spring and we see we'll be developing a spring

02:16.200 --> 02:22.020
and we'll the application making use of time leaf template engine and we'll build more on top of that

02:22.170 --> 02:24.410
throughout the following tutorials.

02:25.450 --> 02:31.080
To check out and understand how resources and static web content handling spring and we see I'll see

02:31.080 --> 02:32.080
you on the next video.
