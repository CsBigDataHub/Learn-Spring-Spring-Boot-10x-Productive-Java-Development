Now let's take a moment to overview what we learned in this section up until now.

00:06.250 --> 00:12.820
In this section we've taken an overview of and we see and Springhill we see Application Development

00:14.350 --> 00:21.730
Dan we learned how spring handles resources and static content with resources directory.

00:21.750 --> 00:26.570
We understood what template thing is and what a template engine does.

00:26.670 --> 00:29.570
And as a result we took a closer look at time.

00:29.570 --> 00:35.770
We have template engine which is the one that we choose and keep using in the following sections.

00:35.820 --> 00:41.540
With time we've we worked on a simple application to test out the capabilities of time we've Anggun

00:41.790 --> 00:44.810
and certainly a template page with our controller.

00:45.090 --> 00:52.750
And finally I gave you an exercise so that you could check out and play around with timely engine.

00:52.820 --> 00:57.830
I hope you did well on your assignment and created everything you need to serve a template from your

00:57.830 --> 00:59.200
web application.

01:00.300 --> 01:07.520
In order to dive into another ryd aspect of spring and that is spring data then Alcyone the next section.
