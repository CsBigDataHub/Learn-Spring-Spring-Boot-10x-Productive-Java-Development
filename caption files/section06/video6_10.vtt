00:00.420 --> 00:07.200
Now let's take an overview of what we learned so far in the section and this section will coward.

00:07.200 --> 00:12.150
One of the greatest components of spring family and that was spring data.

00:12.150 --> 00:17.000
We discussed what GPA is and what exactly spring data adds onto it.

00:17.880 --> 00:25.800
We also discovered the H-2 database again it was an in memory database and let either use it a file

00:25.930 --> 00:34.030
or simply in memory that was also what we use within our applications dummy moved on to creating an

00:34.030 --> 00:39.870
entity and had it created as an actual table within our H-2 database.

00:39.910 --> 00:47.320
We also created ourselves a repository and that repository we saved updated and basically manipulated

00:47.320 --> 00:49.080
our data in different ways.

00:50.960 --> 00:57.740
Down we moved on to queering our data with spring data and JPA with the repository we created in the

00:57.920 --> 00:59.810
creating repository section.

00:59.960 --> 01:05.970
We added our own named methods as queries and repository handled them all for us.

01:06.140 --> 01:12.200
After finishing our implementations I wanted you to go ahead and start implementing your own entities

01:12.200 --> 01:15.620
are repositories with this way.

01:15.830 --> 01:19.540
You could have a practical understanding of supplying data.

01:19.560 --> 01:24.600
I hope you did well on your exercise and if you have any problems with it I'll be more than happy to

01:24.600 --> 01:26.350
help you.

01:26.370 --> 01:27.140
All right.

01:27.300 --> 01:29.790
We're coming to an end of a productive session.

01:29.790 --> 01:34.220
And in the next section we're going to dive deep with the rest API.

01:34.890 --> 01:37.840
So to start 12 unrestful API as with spring.

01:38.070 --> 01:39.420
I'll see you on the next section.
