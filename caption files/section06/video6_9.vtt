00:07.900 --> 00:15.070
start implementing your entities and properties and I don't take them as you like create an interface

00:15.100 --> 00:21.310
for your repository to interact with your entities and at Korey's that you can use to find and manipulate

00:21.310 --> 00:22.030
your data.

00:22.880 --> 00:27.090
Set your own moment build upon your architecture as much as you want.

00:28.230 --> 00:34.040
While doing all these either use the code that I've provided within this section or start from the scratch

00:35.500 --> 00:39.380
I'm sure you'll do great on this exercise and how fun doing so.

00:40.580 --> 00:45.360
