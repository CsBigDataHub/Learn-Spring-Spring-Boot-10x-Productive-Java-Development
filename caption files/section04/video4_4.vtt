00:00.480 --> 00:04.320
Now let's take a moment to overhear what we learn in this section.

00:04.320 --> 00:12.950
Up until now in this section we've taken a very close look at Spring Application Lifecycle and how everything

00:12.950 --> 00:17.580
is brought together seamlessly by Spring Framework for any Boot application.

00:18.600 --> 00:23.920
Then we went in-depth with dependency injection and inversion of control.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.970
We discussed what the issue with the software development and how spring tackle this problem in its

00:29.970 --> 00:31.510
own way.

00:32.060 --> 00:39.060
We analyzed application of properties and application that YAML files and considered our alternatives

00:39.060 --> 00:43.320
for different environments and different setups.

00:43.350 --> 00:51.110
We checked outsprint configuration and holstering provides us another great way to configure our application.

00:51.490 --> 00:57.370
Then with spring profiles we discovered a beautiful way to separate our application environments and

00:57.370 --> 01:03.330
dependencies whenever we need taking a look back on what we've done in this section.

01:03.470 --> 01:10.250
Well Khowar a lot of great aspects of our fundamental springboard application development scenario.

01:10.250 --> 01:16.220
If you're ready to get hands on with spring and see and start developing with spring in no time then

01:16.220 --> 01:17.900
I'll see on the next section.
